[Sep 2019] No Unspecified, but [+D] can be Impoverished.
	So for Jim it would need to be triggered by particular roots.
	And only some of the time.
	And it would have semantic effects.
	So you'd need to say that it happens in the syntax-syntax, and not early in spell-out (before linearization etc) as Jim would want to continue assuming. And this is what people usually assume, e.g. Harbour (2003).


[Oct 2019] Appl alternative.
eat/feed, write/dictate. Even hedxik might be "ingestive low Appl-INTO".
CAUS <-> Voice[+D] / __ Appl?
SMPL <-> Voice[+D] / elsewhere

Me: Which brings us back to heXYiZ, where either we need to really stretch the semantics of Appl heads to the point where in my view it becomes vacuous. And besides, you'd need to explain how come in many of these verbs the goal/benefactive is optional.
	Jim: But this optionality is generally characteristic of Appl... cross-linguistically, it's actually hard to find cases where an indirect object is obligatory, and every language with IOs seems to more robustly have them optionally, English included. So what you are pointing at is that the template doesn't reflect the presence/absence of the argument; but this could be like clitic doubling in Spanish (where the clitic is there regardless of whether the argument is), at least formally. 
	Me: Though if your theory allows for a very flexible semantic denotation and syntactic projection/licensing behavior of Appl, I'll need to see what other arguments remain (by which I mean I'm sure that literature is there, I just never looked at it properly).
Jim: So maybe there's at least an expletive Appl some of the time, and a contentful Appl some of the time.

Alternative, where F fills in the triplets that cannot be accounted for with Appl:
Voice{D} <-> CAUS / __ {root1, root2, Appl, F}
				<-> SMPL / elsewhere
Voice{} <-> MID / __ {root1, root2}
				<-> SMPL / elsewhere
	Me: 1. I think you've covered most of your bases through this judicious use of [F]! But I worry we're teetering dangerously close to Arad-land now, where list the conjugation classes and templates that a given root participates in. I mean, why would Appl and F form a natural class?
		Jim: True, but it sort of depends at least in part on what F turns out to be. (So, I'd have to understand the exceptions better to have a proposal here.) 
		Jim: Deponents take a certain form of Voice without the semantics of that form. So you could have something systematic and then a diacritic for exceptions. However, if the exceptions are systematic then this shouldn't be the right way.
			Me: Interestingly innovations are hardly ever in XaYaZ, but then not in heXYiZ either.
		(Jim and I differ on how systematic deponents are, and this also depends on the language. Could be that they're fairly uniform in Icelandic but less so in Latin and Greek.)
	Me: 2. Also, you can accidentally derive a labile alternation in XaYaZ. Say Root3 is not on either of the two lists. Then with Voice{D} it's XaYaZ and with Voice{} it's also XaYaZ.
	




[Nov 2019] Unaccusatives in hefil: Jim would've expected Pred[+D] as another version of Voice[+D]/i*[+D].
	Unacc: [VoiceP Voice [vP v [PredP DP [ Pred[+D] [aP red ]]]]] 
	Causative option 1: [VoiceP DP Voice [vP v [PredP DP [ Pred[+D] [aP red ]]]]] 
	Causative option 2: [VoiceP DP Voice[+D] [vP v [PredP DP [ Pred[+D] [aP red ]]]]] (Jim thinks this one is better system-internally because the root/v always chooses Voice[+D] for that alloseme, not Unspecified.
	Me 1: Combinatorics etc.
	Me 2: Pred[-D].
		Jim: Thought that "He turned invisible to avoid being detected" or "The magician turned red to impress the audience" were the adjectival counterparts of figure reflexives. But whether or not those are the right examples, thinks the theory allows it, so we have to reckon with that.
		Also figure reflexives but no (overt) p[+D].
	Me 3: Morphophonology at-a-distance of Pred[+D] conoditioned by T but Voice between them not conditioned.
		Jim: Same issue for p[-D] though.
In the i* chapter of Voice[+D] chapter? Probably Voice[+D].



check:
     I think one thing I am really going to have to understand better is exactly what ways roots are choosy about structures. So, if a root licensing unspecified Voice (which I'll call Voice{+/-D}), my original thought would be that it should allow XaYaZ with either a causative or anticausative reading. After all, Voice can have, but need not have a specifier. But from your last email, I am gathering that this is not the case. If a root occurs with Voice{+/-D}, then that particular Root-Voice{+/-D} combination will either have a SpecVoiceP or not? 
    That is, empirically, given a particular root in XaYaZ, it will either be transitive or unaccusative (or unergative, etc.). Is that right? If so, why should this be, in your system? 

A given root has to choose a given interpretation when combining with a relevant functional head in this system. It's a bit like the Arad/Marantz hypothesis. But I have no useful way of formalizing this point or deriving it from anything else.




One other question: how many "triplets" do you have of roots that occur with Voice, Voice+D and Voice[-D]? Is there a list of them somewhere in the book?
I don’t have a curated list of all triplets. I just checked the “database” (Ehrenfeld’s excel file) and there are 147 roots that are instantiated in all three templates (out of 1875 roots in total), but there’s a lot of noise in that spreadsheet.
What I do have is ten or so triplets that I picked out for some computational work. I don't remember my selection criteria (this was just for playing around with some scripts) but I think these might be the most obvious cases of a semantic relationship of at least some kind:
XaYaZ 		niXYaZ 		heXYiZ 	
axal 	ate 	neexal 	was eaten 	heexil 	fed
