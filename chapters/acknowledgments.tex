``However, one shouldn’t forget that I wrote a very long dissertation turned book in the early 1980’s that concerned the relationship between word formation and syntax. The work is titled, “On the Nature of Grammatical Relations,” because it is, in a sense, a paean to Relational Grammar.'' And mine is a paean to Doron and Arad.
