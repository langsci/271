\section{Non-active verbs}
This section presents the first class of verbs in niXYaZ, defending the following hypothesis: verbs in this class are unaccusative (anticausative). The idea that verbs in this template are anticausative variants of those in XaYaZ is certainly not new. However, the explicit morphosyntactic implementation is (following \cite{kastner17gjgl}), providing a necessary backdrop for the novel claims about figure reflexives and nominalizations. We present the relevant data and diagnostics in section @ and our proposal in section @.

Data
This section concerns verbs such as those in (@), which we analyze as non-active. Based on the diagnostics discussed below, we have found that @@ of the @@ verbs in niXYaZ are non-active, or ambiguous between non-active and figure reflexive.

(@) niʃbar   'broke'
    nigmar   'ended'
    nisgar   'closed'
    nimtax   'stretched'
    nifsak  'stopped'

The diagnostics used here are compatibility with various agent-oriented adverbs, including the use of ‘by itself’, and the two standard unaccusativity diagnostics for Hebrew.

Adverbial modifiers
A common assumption in studies of anticausativity is that the existence of an agent can be probed using adverbial modifiers such as adverbs and the phrase 'by itself' \citep{unaccusativity95,alexiadouanagnostopoulou04,koontzgarboden09,alexiadoudoron12,kastner17gjgl}. Hebrew me-aʦmo 'by itself' diagnoses the non-existence of an external argument, regardless of whether the external argument is explicit (as in transitive verbs) or implicit (as in passives). The test is appropriate with anticausatives in the niXYaZ template shown above, (@), but not with direct objects of transitive verbs, (@), or with passive verbs, (@). The examples are adapted from \cite{kastner17gjgl}.
    ha-kise niʃbar me-aʦmo.
       the-chair broke.MID from-itself
       'The chair fell apart (of its own accord).'
    
* miri ʃavra et ha-kise me-aʦmo.
       Miri broke.SMPL ACC the-chair from-itself
         (int. 'Miri broke the chair of its own accord')
     
         * ha-kise porak me-aʦmo.
         the-chair dismantled.INTNS}.Pass from-itself
         (int. 'The chair was dismantled of its own accord')
    
         * ha-sveder nisrag me-aʦmo.
         the-sweater knitted.MID from-itself
         (int. 'The sweater was knitted of its own accord')
    
Anticausatives are also incompatible with by-phrases, which would otherwise refer to an agent.

     * ha-ʦamid niʃbar al-jedej ha-tsoref.
     the-bracelet broke.MID by the-jeweler
     (int. 'The bracelet was dismantled by the jeweler')

Agent-oriented adverbs are likewise incompatible with anticausatives.

     ha-ʦamid niʃbar be-mejomanut.
     the-bracelet broke.MID in-skill
     (int. 'The bracelet was dismantled skillfully')
 
Unaccusativity diagnostics

The syntactic literature on Hebrew has identified two unaccusativity diagnostics. These diagnostics are VS order and the possessive dative, although it is important to acknowledge that their status as robust tests has been challenged in recent years \citep{gafter14li,linzen14pd,kastner17gjgl}. Crucially for our purposes, the two classes of verbs behave differently with regards to these diagnostics.

The first test is the ordering of the subject and the verb. Modern Hebrew is typically SV(O), but promoted subjects may appear after the verb, resulting in VS order. This is true for both unaccusatives, (@), and passives, (@), presumably because the underlying object remains in its original VP-internal position. Unergatives do not allow VS, with the exception of a marked structure referred to as ''stylistic inversion'', @. For additional discussion see \cite{shlonsky87}, to whom the test is attributed, as well as \cite{shlonskydoron91}, \cite{borer95} and \cite{preminger10} for other aspects.

nafl-u ʃaloʃ kosot be-ʃmone ba-boker.         V Internal Argument
     fell.SMPL-3PL three glasses in-eight in.the-morning
     'Three glasses fell at 8am.'
    
    @@passive example@@

     # jilel-u ʃloʃa xatulim be-ʃmone ba-boker.    * External argument
         whined-3PL three cats in-eight in.the-morning
        'And thence whined three cats at 8am.' (Marked variant)
   
The second unaccusativity diagnostic is the possessive dative, a construction in which the possessor appears in a prepositional phrase in a separate constituent from the possessee (possessor raising). This construction is taken to be unique to internal arguments in the language \citep{borergrodzinsky86}.

A transitive construction is compatible with the possessive dative, (@), as is a non-active construction in niXYaZ, whereas an unergative verb leads to an affected interpretation of the kind discussed by \cite{arieletal15} and \cite{barashersiegalboneh16}, (@). 

dana ʃavra l-i et ha-ʃaon.        Internal Argument
 Dana broke.SMPL to-me ACC the-watch
 'Dana broke my watch.'

      niʃbar l-i ha-ʃaon
         broke.MID to-me the-watch
         'My watch broke.'
                 
        # jilel-u l-i ʃloʃet ha-xatulim        * External argument
         whined.INTNS-3PL to-me three the-cats
         'The three cats whined and I was adversely affected.' (int. 'My three cats whined')
   
Taken together, these tests provide strong evidence for the common assumption that at least some verbs in niXYaZ are anticausative. A formal analysis follows next.
Analysis
Our analysis is cast in Distributed Morphology \citep{dm}, in particular adopting the assumption that Voice is the functional head introducing the external argument \citep{kratzer96,pylkkanen08}. We also adopt the treatment of non-active verbs in Hebrew proposed by \cite{alexiadoudoron12} and \cite{kastner17gjgl}, in which non-actives are derived by merging a non-active variant of Voice, namely Voice[-D], following similar proposals for German \citep{schaefer08,layering15}, English \cite{bruening14nllt}, Greek \citep{alexiadoudoron12,spathasetal15}, Icelandic \citep{wood15springer} and Latin \citep{kastnerzu15li}, although some details differ between the implementations.

The full typology of Voice heads has been explored in recent work by \cite{kastner16phd,kastner17gjgl,kastner16nllt,kastner18}, \cite{oseki17nyu} and \cite{nie17}. For our purposes in this paper, the only relevant distinction is between "underspecified" Voice and non-active Voice[-D]. The [±D] feature is an EPP feature which either requires a DP in its specifier ([+D]), prohibits a DP in its specifier ([-D]) or is indifferent to whether Spec,VoiceP is filled.

(@)    Voice[-D] \citep{kastner17gjgl}
    A Voice head with a [-D] feature, prohibiting anything with a [D] feature from merging in its specifier. 
    As typically assumed for unaccusative little v} or unaccusative Voice, {Voice[-D]} does not assign accusative case itself \citep{chomsky95} or through the calculation of dependent case \citep{marantz91}.
⟦Voice⟧ = λxλe.Agent(x,e)
⟦Voice[-D]⟧ = λP<s,t>.P

In the phonological component, the Vocabulary Items for the two variants differ, (@). Some morphophonological details are fleshed out in \citep{kastner16nllt}.
    Voice ↔ XaYaZ
    Voice[-D] ↔ niXYaZ

These functional heads function in the following way. Verb phrases (vPs) contain no reference to the external argument, since that role is licensed by Voice. What this means is that a vP is simply a predicate of events, potentially transitive ones. The verb ʃavar 'broke' is made up of a vP, denoting a set of breaking events, and a head introducing an addition external argument.

    XaYaZ, ʃavar 'broke' 


Anticausative verbs differ minimally in that no external argument is introduced. In line with the claim that causatives and anticausatives are derived from a common core \citep{layering15}, the grammar might build a transitive vP as above (verbalizer, root and internal argument) and merging Voice[-D]. This configuration gives us niʃbar 'broke' in (@). Since no external argument can be merged in the specifier of Voice[-D], the structure in (@) is unaccusative.


    niXYaZ, niʃbar 'got broken' 


This basic distinction between Voice and Voice[-D] in the syntax thus feeds differences across the interfaces, as in previous work on Hebrew and beyond: the spell-out is different, the semantics is different and the resulting constructions are different. This basic machinery allows us to derive some typical argument structure alternations in the language. The next section proposes a different analysis for another class of verbs in niXYaZ, one which correlates their different syntax and semantics with different morphosyntactic configurations.


\section{Height of attachment: Figure reflexives}
The previous section identified a class of verbs in niXYaZ which are demonstrably non-active. In the current section we propose that another class of niXYaZ verbs exists, and a fairly large one at that. We call these figure reflexives (following \cite{woord14nllt}) and defend the claim that they have an external argument and an obligatory prepositional phrase as their complement but are otherwise intransitive, i.e unergative. Figure reflexives might denote an action (@@), motion (@@) or psych-verb (@@), but in all cases, a prepositional phrase is the obligatory complement of the verb. We will confirm that these verbs are active and then present a structure which involves an agent in Spec,VoiceP and a prepositional phrase complement to the verb.
Data
This section concerns verbs such as those in (@), which we analyze as figure reflexives. Based on the diagnostics discussed below, we have found that @@ of the @@ verbs in niXYaZ are figure reflexive, or ambiguous between a non-active and a figure reflexive reading.
   
(@)     nixnas  *(le-)  'entered (into)' 
        nidxaf  *(derex/le-)  'pushed his way through/into' 
        nirʃam  *(le-)  'signed up for' 
        nilxam  *(be-)  'fought (with)' 
        neexaz  *(be-)  'held on to' 
    
We repeat the diagnostics from Section @ below, showing that figure reflexives pattern the opposite way from non-actives. We then highlight the role of the complement to the verb.
Adverbial modifiers
'By itself' is not possible:
     * dana nixnesa la-kita me-aʦma
         Dana entered.MID to.the-classroom from-itself

Agent-oriented adverbs are possible with figure reflexives:
         dana nixnesa la-kita be-bitaxon
         Dana entered.MID to.the-classroom in-confidence
         'Dana confidently entered the classroom.'

By-phrases are an irrelevant diagnostic when the external argument is explicit.
Unaccusativity diagnostics

Figure reflexives fail the accepted unaccusativity diagnostics, unlike non-active verbs,

VS order is unavailable, again being grammatical but resulting in “stylistic inversion”:
 # nixnes-u ʃaloʃ xajal-ot la-kita
         entered.MID-3PL three soldiers-F.PL to.the-classroom
         (int. 'Three soldiers entered the classroom.')

The possessive dative is likewise incompatible with figure reflexives; example (@) is infelicitous on a reading where the cat is the speaker's.
        # ha-xatul nixnas l-i la-xeder (kol ha-zman), ma laasot?
         the-cat enters.MID to-me to.the-room (all the-time) what to.do
         (int. 'My cat keeps coming into into my room, what should I do?')

This brief comparison with non-actives shows that figure reflexives pattern differently. That is one main difference, namely the existence of an external argument. The second is the complement of these verbs, as we highlight next.
Indirect objects

The novel observation about finite verbs in niXYaZ - which will carry into a generalization in Section @ on nominalizations - is that figure reflexives take an obligatory prepositional phrase. The list in (@) is repeated from (@).
(@)     nixnas  *(le-)  'entered (into)' 
        nidxaf  *(derex/le-)  'pushed his way through/into' 
        nirʃam  *(le-)  'signed up for' 
        nilxam  *(be-)  'fought (with)' 
        neexaz  *(be-)  'held on to' 

This claim has not been made before in either the traditional grammars or contemporary work, as far as we can tell (the closest are \citet[87]{berman78}, who stated that some verbs show ''ingression'', and \cite{schwarzwald08}, who noted that some verbs in this template are active). The resulting generalization is that external arguments in niXYaZ are possible if and only if a prepositional phrase is required, a claim borne out by @ verbs in our database. This generalization can be derived from the analysis in the next section.
Analysis
Our treatment of prepositional phrases requires us to be more explicit about their internal structure. We do that in section @ and then discuss the compositional mechanism at work in section @. The pieces are put together in section @.
Prepositional phrases
Now that we have convinced ourselves of the fact that figure reflexives are active verbs, we turn to their complements. In order to be precise about the argument structure of prepositions, we adopt the idea that subjects of prepositional phrases are introduced by a separate functional head. This suggestion was made in one way or another by a number of authors \citep{vanriemsdijk90,rooryck96,koopman97,gehrke08phd,dendikken03,dendikken10}. though what is striking is that these accounts dealt with various empirical phenomena, none of which is the same as the case discussed here. Most concretely we follow \cite{svenonius03,svenonius07,svenonius10} who implements this idea using the functional head p. Borrowing terminology from \cite{talmy78} and related work, \cite{wood14nllt} is explicit in calling the DP in Spec,pP the Figure and the complement of P the Ground.

The dashed arrows in (@) show the assignment of semantic (thematic) roles, in a system without theta-roles as primitives \cite{schaefer08,layering15,wood14nllt,wood15springer,woodmarantz17,myler16,kastner17gjgl}; this difference is often referred to as “syntactic transitivity” versus “semantic transitivity”. For now, all that matters is that functional heads can make syntactic requirements (as with the [D] feature) and introduce semantic roles (as with Voice).

    ⟦Voice⟧  =  λxλe.Agent(x,e) 
    ⟦p⟧  =  λxλs.Figure(x,s) 

A concrete example of an ordinary prepositional phrase in Hebrew - a pP - is given in (@), for a verb in the “simple” template XaYaZ. This template has been argued to comprise minimal verbal structure, here v and Voice \citep{doron03,borer13oup,kastner16nllt,kastner17gjgl}.

   (@)      eliana sama sefer al ha-ʃulxan
         Eliana put book on the-table
         'Eliana put a book on the table.'    
    

Consider next the similarities between Voice and p. Both introduce external arguments within their extended projection and both are usually silent (though Voice can be argued to trigger the phonology of XaYaZ in Hebrew). We have assumed that a variant of Voice exists, Voice[-D], which prohibits the Merge of a DP in its specifier. Continuing this reasoning, and following \cite{wood15springer}, we further postulate a variant of p, namely p[-D], which prohibits the Merge of a DP in Spec,pP.

(@)    p[-D]:
    p[-D] (pronounced ''little p zero'' or ''little p minus dee'') is a p head with a [-D] feature, prohibiting anything with a [D] feature from merging in its specifier.
    ⟦p[-D]⟧ = ⟦p⟧ = λxλs.Figure(x,s)

    Voice[-D] and p[-D] are spelled out identically in Hebrew: a prefix (ni-) and stem vowels, resulting in niXYaZ. In section @ we return to the idea that these are one and the same head, i*, differing only in its height of attachment. But first, the compositional details.

Delayed saturation

Since syntactic and semantic requirements of functional heads are separated, a given head might impose a semantic requirement which is fulfilled immediately. If the semantic predicate is saturated later on in the derivation, we have a case of delayed saturation. Such cases have been recently identified (as “delayed gratification”) in work on Icelandic \citep{wood14nllt,wood15springer}, English, Quechua \citep{myler16mit} and Japanese \citep{woodmarantz17}, as well as for reflexive verbs in Hebrew \citep{kastner17gjgl}, although the idea that a predicate may be saturated in delayed fashion is of course not new in and of itself \citep{higginbotham85}.

The current analysis follows closely \citeauthor{wood15springer}’s (\citeyear{wood15springer}) analysis of certain figure reflexives in Icelandic. The name itself is meant to invoke the Figure-like, reflexive-like interpretation of a Figure in a prepositional phrase when it is the complement of certain verbs. The intuition is that the role of Figure is not saturated within the pP, since no DP is possible in Spec,pP. Rather, an argument introduced later on (the agent) saturates the predicate. The schematic in (@) shows the saturation of semantic roles.



A concrete derivation is given in (@) for the figure reflexive nixnas le- ‘entered’ in niXYaZ. Note again that p[-D] expects a Figure semantically but does not introduce one in the syntax.

    oren nixnas la-xeder Oren entered the room'



The pP is composed via Event Identification, the vP via Function Composition (Restrict \cite{chungladusaw04}?), and the VoiceP again via Event Identification.

⟦PP⟧ = λs.in(s,room)
        ⟦p[-D]⟧ = λxλs.Figure(x,s)
        Via Event Identification:
        ⟦pP⟧ = λxλs.Figure(x,s) & in(s,room) 
        ⟦v⟧ = λPλe∃s.P(s) & enter(e) & Cause(e,s)
    Via Function Composition (Restrict \cite{chungladusaw04}?)
           ⟦vP⟧ = λxλe∃s.Figure(x,s) & in(s,room) & enter(e) & Cause(e,s)
        ⟦Voice⟧ = λxλe.Agent(x,e)
       ⟦Voice'⟧ = λxλe∃s.Agent(x,e)} & Figure(x,s) & in(s,room) & enter(e) & Cause(e,s)
        ⟦VoiceP⟧ = ⟦Voice'⟧(Danny) = 
        λe∃s.Agent(Danny,e) & Figure(Danny,s) & in(s,room) & enter(e) & Cause(e,s) 
        ''The set of entering events, for which Danny is the Agent, and which cause Danny to be in the room''

The two main consequences of this configuration are that an external argument may be merged in Spec,VoiceP and that the obligatory prepositional phrase does not have a subject of its own. Since p[-D] does not allow anything to be merged in its specifier, the preposition ‘in’ p[-D] does not have an immediate subject. Instead, the predicate p[-D] “waits” until the external argument is merged in Spec,VoiceP and this DP is then interpreted as the subject of the preposition. The generalization on figure reflexives receives an explanation: external arguments in niXYaZ saturate the Figure role of an otherwise subjectless preposition.
Interim summary: Actives, non-actives and passives
The core puzzle of verbal forms in niXYaZ has now been addressed: internal and external arguments are possible across this template, but not within the same verb. We suggested that two distinct verb classes exist which share the same morphology. Non-active verbs in niXYaZ are unaccusative: the sole argument is the internal argument and there is no agentive external argument. Figure reflexives are active verbs which have an agentive external argument and must take a prepositional complement. We have proposed a generalization correlating the external argument with a pP complement and explained it structurally by making reference to the height and featural makeup of independently proposed functional heads. This analysis supports a specific view of argument structure which distinguishes between syntactic features, such as the requirement for a specifier, and semantic roles, such as the requirement for an Agent or a Figure.

One point remains to be made before we move on to nominalizations with this analysis as a backdrop. We have assumed that Voice[-D] and p[-D] are spelled out the same, or trigger the same morphophonological processes. Unless anything additional is said, this similarity remains an accident. It has recently been proposed by \cite{woodmarantz17} that heads such as Voice, Appl and p are in fact contextual variants of the same functional head, which they call i*. On their view - which we will not explore in detail here - "Voice" is simply the name we give to i* which takes a vP complement, "high Appl" is the name we give to i* which takes a vP complement and is in turn embedded in a higher i* (itself being Voice), "p" is the name we give to an i* which takes a PP complement, and so on.

To round off the treatment of verbal forms, we briefly discuss alternative analyses.
Alternatives
We assumed an ''emergent'' view of templates, according to which they arise from the combination of functional heads. The traditional approach to Semitic templates approaches them as primitives, but has been shown to fall short of understanding the argument structure alternations in the system \citep{doron03,kastner16phd,kastner17gjgl,kastner18}. The idea that that templates are morphemes can be implemented in various ways, including distinct spell-outs of Voice \citep{arad05}, distinct exo-skeletal functors \citep{borer13oup}, conjugation classes \citep{aronoff07}, and lexicalist morphemes \citep{reinhartsiloni05,laks11,laks14}.

As far as morphemic analyses are concerned, an overarching problem is that a given template does not have a deterministic syntax nor does it have a deterministic semantics; this much should be clear from the current paper so far. The morphemic analysis would have to say that niXYaZ is ambiguous between a non-active and figure reflexive reading. Two crucial problems then arise. The first is that not all verbs in this template are ambiguous. The second is that the existing readings are an accident; the template could just as well have been ambiguous between a transitive and a reflexive reading, but no Hebrew template has this property \citep{doron05,kastner16phd}. The emergent theories have principled explanations for what is and is not possible, as with niXYaZ where we have shown a morphological correlation between lack of Agent and lack of Figure. In contrast, a morphemic theory is unnecessarily powerful and must arbitrarily list what each template, and perhaps each verb, may do.

Within the emergent theories, the most obvious alternative is the morphosemantic system of \cite{doron03}, a direct forebear to the current theory. That theory did not engage with figure reflexives directly, but instead derived all reflexive readings using a REFL head. This is not a useful morphosyntactic construct since it cannot distinguish, on its own, between a figure reflexive, a reflexive verb such as ‘shave’ and a construction with an anaphor such as ‘shave yourself’. Yet we have seen that figure reflexives have specific syntactic and semantic characteristics, which distinguish them from intransitive reflexives like ‘shave’ (the latter, for instance, does not require or even allow a prepositional phrase complement). We conclude that “templates” are the by-product of functional heads combining in the syntax in systematic ways.


\section{Agentive modification}
Reflexive verbs have posed a long-standing puzzle for theories of argument structure: one argument appears to have two thematic roles, agent and patient. If \emph{John kicked}, John could not have kicked himself, but if \emph{John shaved}, it is clear that he shaved himself. The reflexive reading for \emph{shave} arises even without a reflexive anaphor. While some languages, like English, do not differentiate morphologically between verbs like \emph{shave} and verbs like \emph{kick}, many languages do express reflexivity through morphological means. The degree to which this state of affairs is problematic varies from theory to theory, but reflexive verbs are predominantly marked morphologically, suggesting that the morphosyntax might be marked as well.

Within contemporary generative work two questions regarding reflexive verbs have risen to the fore. The first is whether there exist dedicated reflexivizers, operators whose sole job is to reduce the arity of a predicate, or whether this job is carried out through a conspiracy of other components of the grammar. Both options carry implications for where the origin of morphological marking lies and what it tracks. If dedicated reflexivizers are part of the morphological toolkit of any grammar, we might expect to find them in many languages. In contrast, if reflexive marking arises through a combination of other means, we would need to identify what these are on a language-by-language basis.

The second question is whether reflexive verbs are unaccusative or unergative: where is the argument generated and how does it come to be the subject of the clause. This question is tied to the environments that are licensed by a reflexive verb, as we will see below.

In general, the answers to both of these questions may well vary by language. On the question of dedicated reflexivizers, \cite{reinhartsiloni05} and \cite{labelle08} answer in the affirmative for Hebrew and French, while \cite{lidz01} answers in the negative for Kannada. Analyses of reflexive constructions without reflexivizers have been put forward in other languages as well, including Greek \citep{spathasetal15} and Latin \citep{miller10latin}. The verbal morphology of Modern Hebrew can shed further light on these debates since argument structure alternations are reflected in the templatic morphology of the language.

The current paper presents a novel analysis of reflexives in Hebrew, one that does not make use of a reflexivizer as such and that treats reflexives as unaccusative. Any analysis of Hebrew requires an understanding of how the non-concatenative morphological system is derived. The current account of reflexive verbs is couched in a general theory of the Semitic verb, employing contemporary theories of morphology in order to analyze a peculiarity of Hebrew: reflexive verbs are only possible in one of the verbal templates, specifically the most complex one morphophonologically.


Of interest in the current paper is the ``complex'' template {\thit}, exemplified in~(\ref{ex:intro-anticaus})--(\ref{ex:intro-recip}). The typical alternation for this template is an anticausative one, between a transitive verb in {\tpie} and an anticausative in {\thit} (the notation \dgs{Y} indicates lack of spirantization, a phonological process I return to in Section \ref{sec:refl}). We will focus on the fact that verbs in {\thit} can have other readings associated with them, (\ref{ex:intro-refl})--(\ref{ex:intro-recip}), besides an anticausative correspondent of {\tpie}.

The puzzle posed by {\thit} is the following: why is it that reflexive verbs appear only in this template and not in any of the others? This question is inherently tied to two related questions: why is this template morphophonologically complex, and what is the range of verbs that may be instantiated in it. To answer these questions, I will propose that reflexives and anticausatives share an unaccusative structure, but that the lexical semantics of the root constrains the derivation. Specifically, reflexive verbs are argued to be the result of unaccusative syntax with an agentive modifier and self-oriented lexical semantics. These notions will be made explicit in Sections \ref{sec:anticaus:analysis} and \ref{sec:refl:analysis}. The thrust of the argument is that reflexive readings fall out naturally once certain elements are combined in the syntax, elements which are independently attested in the grammar.

	\subsection{Anticausatives}

Anticausatives in {\thit} are no different. The unprefixed base forms in {\tpie} is active, (\nextx a), but the derived verb is compatible with `by itself', (\nextx b).
\pex
\a \begingl
\gla ha-{\texttslig}oref \textbf{pirek} et ha-{\texttslig}amid.//

\glb the-bracelet dismantled.\gsc{INTNS.MID} from-itself//
\glft `The bracelet fell apart of its own accord.'//
\endgl
\xe

Other traditional tests such as incompatibility with \emph{by}-phrases and agent-oriented adverbs support the claim that the derived verbs are indeed unaccusative, (\nextx).\footnote{For additional discussion of these diagnostics, see the recent discussion on reflexivity as anticausativity \citep{koontzgarboden09,beaverskoontzgarboden13b,beaverskoontzgarboden13a,horvathsiloni11,horvathsiloni13,lundquistetal16,schaefervivanco16}. I do not take an explicit stand on this issue in the current paper, focusing instead on the structures that generate different readings.}

\glft (int. `The bracelet was dismantled by the jeweler/skillfully')//
\endgl
\xe

Two language-specific diagnostics have also been proposed in the literature: VS order and the possessive dative. These tests align with the ones above, as shown next.

		\subsubsection{Order of subject and verb}
The word order of Modern Hebrew is typically SV(O) as seen in all of the examples above, but unaccusatives allow the verb to appear before the underlying object, (\ref{ex:vs-unacc}a). Presumably this is because the underlying object stays low in its base-generated position, (\ref{ex:vs-unacc}b). Unergatives do not allow VS order except for the marked structure known as ``stylistic inversion'', (\ref{ex:vs-unerg}); see \cite{shlonsky87}, \cite{shlonskydoron91} and \cite{borer95}.

	\endgl
\xe

Anticausatives in {\thit} allow VS order just like their counterparts in~{\tnif}: (\ref{ex:vs-anticaus}) patterns with (\ref{ex:vs-unacc}).

	\gla\rightcomment{\gsc{\cmark~Internal Argument}}\textbf{hitpark-u} \glemph{ʃloʃa} \glemph{galgalim} be-ʃmone ba-boker.//

	\glft `Three wheels fell apart at 8am.'//
	\endgl
\xe

		\subsubsection{Possessive datives}
The second diagnostic is the possessive dative, a type of possessor raising. This construction has been claimed to only be possible with internal arguments \citep{borergrodzinsky86}, though we return to critiques of it in Section \ref{sec:disc:unacc:pd}.

A simple unaccusative like \emph{nafal} `fell' in the underspecified \tkal~template is compatible with a possessive dative, (\nextx a), as is a transitive construction, (\nextx b), whereas an unergative verb leads to a deviant, affected interpretation, (\nextx c). Anticausatives in {\thit} are compatible with possessive datives, (\anextx).

	\subsubsection{Analysis}
Focusing back on {\thit}, it is evident that \emph{hit-} is a prefix, rather than a higher dummy DP or clitic (like French \emph{se} in \citealt{labelle08} or German \emph{sich} in \citealt{schaefer08}) since its form is conditioned by tense and agreement, (\nextx), a hallmark of agreement affixes \citep{nevins11asl}.
\ex Some forms of \emph{hitlabeʃ} `he dressed up':\\
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
	a.& \emph{\textbf{hit}labeʃ} & Past & 3\gsc{SG.M}\\
	b.& \emph{\textbf{jit}labeʃ} & Future & 3\gsc{SG.M}\\
	c.& \emph{\textbf{tit}labsʃ-u} & Future & 2\gsc{PL}\\
	\end{tabular}
\xe

Putting aside the exact morphophonological processes, here is how these functional heads work in the syntax. Anticausative verbs are derived by taking an existing transitive vP (one that has a direct object) and merging \vz, thereby detransitivizing the verb. This results in anticausative alternations as in (\ref{ex:alter-caus-smpl}a--b), between \root{ʃbr} with Voice and with {\vz}, and in~(\ref{ex:alter-caus-intns}a--b), between \root{prk} with Voice+{\va} and with {\vz}+{\va} . No external argument can be merged in the specifier of {\vz}, rendering the structures in~(\ref{ex:alter-caus-smpl}b) and (\ref{ex:alter-caus-intns}b) unaccusative.

In~(\ref{ex:alter-caus-smpl}), Voice introduces an external argument and {\vz} blocks one. The same holds for~(\ref{ex:alter-caus-intns}) where the structure also contains the modifier {\va}, whose exact workings will wait for the next section.

In this section I have set up the basic machinery needed to derive argument structure alternations in the language, allowing for a straightforward description of anticausatives using the functional head {\vz}. The next section develops the system in order to account for the main empirical puzzle: reflexive verbs in Hebrew appear in only one of the templates, arguably the most marked one.

	\subsection{Reflexives}
In what follows I turn to reflexives in \thit. It has recently been proposed that dedicated reflexivizers are not necessary in order to derive reflexives in certain languages. I take this claim one step further based on Hebrew, arguing that dedicated reflexivizers are not necessary and that the same functional heads can be used to derive both reflexives and anticausatives, at least in this language. I develop the empirical picture in Section~\ref{sec:refl:bg}, present my analysis in Section~\ref{sec:refl:analysis} and return to tie a loose anticausative end in Section~\ref{sec:refl:anticaus}.

	\subsection{Background} \label{sec:refl:bg}
The main phenomenon analyzed in this paper is as follows. The verbal template {\thit} shows the same morphological marking for reflexives and anticausatives. By ``reflexive verb'' in this article I mean~(\nextx):
\ex \textbf{Canonical reflexive verb}\\
	(i) A monovalent verb whose DP internal argument X is interpreted as both Agent and Theme, \textbf{and} (ii) where no other argument Y (implicit or explicit) can be interpreted as Agent or Theme, \textbf{and} (iii) where the structure involves no pronominal elements such as \emph{himself}.
\xe

With this definition we focus on reflexives that are morphologically marked, rather than other reflexive strategies such as anaphora. These verbs in Hebrew are only attested in \thit. A sample is given in~(\nextx).\footnote{Hebrew has verbs with reflexive-like readings in other templates. In particular, the ``middle'' template {\tnif} has verbs such as \emph{nirsʃam le-} `signed up for', \emph{nitsmad le-} `stuck to', and so on (an anonymous reviewer suggests \emph{nisgar be-} `secluded himself in', which may be subject to idiolectal variation). These verbs all take obligatory PP complements and as such have a different structure than that proposed here for reflexives. They are more similar to the figure reflexives discussed in Section \ref{sec:refl:analysis:delay}; see \citet[Chapter~2.2]{kastner16phd} for an analysis of figure reflexives in {\tnif} and {\thit}.}
\ex\label{ex:refl}\emph{hitgaleax} `shaved himself', \emph{hitraxe\texttslig} `washed himself', \emph{hitnagev} `toweled himself down', \emph{hitaper} `applied makeup to himself', \emph{hitnadev} `volunteered himself'.
\xe

This kind of morphology is reminiscent of markers such as Romance \gsc{SE}, German \emph{sich} and Russian \emph{-sja}. Yet unlike languages like French where \gsc{se} might be ambiguous between a number of readings (reflexive, reciprocal and anticausative), {\thit} is never ambiguous in Hebrew for a given root (this generalization will be qualified in Section \ref{sec:disc:roots}). French \emph{se} can be used in reflexive, reciprocal and non-active contexts with a variety of predicates:
\pex
	\a \textit{French reflexives and reciprocals, after} \citet[839]{labelle08}\\
	\begingl
	\gla Les enfants \glemph{se} sont tous soigneusement \textbf{lav\'es}.//
	\glb the children \gsc{SE} are all carefully washed.\gsc{3PL}//
	\glft `The children all washed each other carefully' \hfill [reciprocal]\\
	`The children all washed themselves carefully' \hfill [reflexive]//
	\endgl

	\a \textit{French middle} \citep[835]{labelle08}\\
	\begingl
	\gla Cette robe \glemph{se} \textbf{lave} facilement.//
	\glb this dress \gsc{SE} wash-\gsc{3S} easily//
	\glft `This dress washes easily.'//
	\endgl
	
	\a \textit{French anticausative} \citep[835]{labelle08}\\
	\begingl
	\gla Le vase \glemph{se} \textbf{brise}.//
	\glb the vase \gsc{SE} breaks-\gsc{3S}//
	\glft `The vase is breaking.'//
	\endgl
\xe

But Hebrew {\thit} is unambiguous. The verb \emph{hitlabeʃ} `got dressed' is deterministically reflexive and cannot be used in an anticausative (or reciprocal) context, as shown by its incompatibility with `by itself' in~(\nextx a). In contrast, the verb \emph{hita\texttslig ben} `got annoyed' is uniformly anticausative and cannot be used with an agent-oriented adverb such as `on purpose' \citep{alexiadouanagnostopoulou04} in~(\nextx b).
\pex \textit{Hebrew}
	\a \begingl
	\gla luk ve-pier \textbf{hitlabʃ-u}. (*me-a{\texttslig}mam)//
	\glb Luc and-Pierre dressed.up.\gsc{INTNS.MID}-\gsc{3PL} \phantom{(*}from-themselves//
	\glft `Luc and Pierre got dressed' \hfill [reflexive only]//
	\endgl

	\a \begingl
	\gla ha-saxkan \textbf{hita\texttslig ben} (*be-xavana) kʃe-lo masru lo.//
	\glb the-player got.annoyed.\gsc{INTNS.MID} \phantom{(*}on-purpose when-\gsc{NEG} passed to.him//
	\glft `The player got annoyed when he wasn't passed the ball.'//
	\endgl
\xe

I argue below that this contrast ultimately derives from the lexical semantics of the root. \emph{Dressing up} is usually something one does on oneself, while \emph{annoying} is usually something that one does to someone else. This notion will be made precise in Section~\ref{sec:refl:anticaus}. For now, note that the root itself is not enough to force a reflexive reading. The root \root{lbʃ} from~(\lastx a) can appear in other templates with non-reflexive (and non-anticausative) meanings. Both examples in~(\nextx) contain transitive verbs, as evidenced by the direct object marker \emph{et}.
\pex
	\a \begingl
		\gla viktor \textbf{lavaʃ} et ha-xalifa ʃelo.//
		\glb Victor wore.\gsc{SMPL} \gsc{ACC} the-suit his//
		\glft `Victor wore his suit.'//
		\endgl
	\a \begingl
		\gla ha-xajatim \textbf{helbiʃ-u} et ha-melex.//
		\glb the-tailors dressed.up.\gsc{CAUS}-\gsc{3PL} \gsc{ACC} the-king//
		\glft `The tailors dressed up the king.'//
		\endgl
\xe

The point is once again that it is not enough for the root to be compatible with a reflexive reading in order for the verb to be reflexive. In English, for instance, \emph{wash} and \emph{shave} do not require any special morphological marking. But in Hebrew, both the root and the template combine to decide the meaning and argument structure of the verb, as I explain next.

The intuition behind the analysis is as follows: reflexive verbs in {\thit} consist of an unaccusative structure with extra agentive semantics. This combination is only possible if the internal argument is allowed to saturate the semantic function of an external argument, in a way I formalize below.


\section{Alternatives}
Verbs in Modern Hebrew are instantiated in one of seven distinct morphophonological templates. Not all will be discussed here: our focus is mainly on the one notated {\thit}, with other templates brought up as necessary. Each template is traditionally associated with a certain kind of argument structure alternation: causative, passive, and so on \citep{berman78,doron03,arad05,borer13oup,kastner16phd}. For example, one typical alternation is between transitive verbs in {\tkal} and their anticausative (detransitivized) variants in {\tnif}. On the notation used here , X, Y and Z are placeholders for the consonants which make up the root, \root{XYZ}; examples are given in IPA. The anticausative alternation for {\tkal}$\sim${\tnif} is shown in~(\ref{ex:patax}). Hebrew does not generally employ a zero-derived labile alternation as with English \emph{open} (transitive) $\sim$ \emph{open} (intransitive).\footnote{Though see \cite{borer91}, \citet[61]{doron03}, \cite{lev15} and \citet[Chapter~2.3.2]{kastner16phd} on {\thif}.} 
\pex\label{ex:patax}
	\a \begingl
		\gla josi \textbf{patax} et ha-ʃaar.//
		\glb Yossi opened.\gsc{SMPL} \gsc{ACC} the-gate//

		\glb the-gate {} opened.\gsc{MID} {} \phantom{*}opened.\gsc{SMPL} {}//
		\glft `The gate opened.'//
		\endgl
\xe

Simple as this alternation may be, it does not generalize to all roots. First, there exist anticausative verbs in {\tnif}, (\nextx), with no causative alternation in {\tkal} from which they could have been derived. While causative variants exist in other templates, it is debatable whether a strict derivational relationship should be postulated as in e.g.~\cite{laks13morpho}. Second, there exist verbs in {\tnif} which are not anticausative, (\anextx): they can be shown to pattern with unergative verbs, rather than unaccusative ones \citep{kastner16phd}. In addition, not all roots instantiate verbs in all seven templates, indicating a high degree of lexical idiosyncrasy: for each root, information must be listed indicating which template it can appear in.

\section{Inchoatives}

%%%%
In this section I begin to make the case for templates as emergent from the combination of distinct functional heads. A central distinction in studies of argument structure is made between internal and external arguments. This contrast has proven crucial for analyses of various issues relating to subject/object asymmetries \citep{marantz84,kratzer96}, case assignment \citep{burzio86,marantz91} and analyses of unaccusativity and unergativity \citep{perlmutter78}, among many related topics. Generalizing over external arguments vs internal arguments has in effect taken over the traditional distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs or between subjects and objects (though see \citealt{legate14}\edit{ or the vast literature on ergativity}).\edit[ If there exists a language that shows a contrast between transitive verbs on the one hand, and intransitive verbs -- both unergative and unaccusative -- on the other, this is a matter that requires further study.]{}

Hebrew has traditionally been viewed as a language distinguishing transitive from intransitive verbs. Two ``intransitive'' templates are examined in this section. For convenience, I use the term ``active'' for structures containing an external argument in the canonical subject position (i.e.~transitives and unergatives), and ``nonactive'' for structures without an external argument (i.e.~unaccusatives). This section discusses two verbal templates in Hebrew which exhibit ``middle'' morphology, meaning morphology that is traditionally taken to indicate nonactive syntax (roughly on a par with Romance \gsc{SE}, Latin -\emph{r}, Russian -\emph{sja} and Icelandic -\emph{st}). The claim is that this morphology should be \edit[dissociated]{distinguished} from the underlying syntactic structure: ``middle'' marking in Hebrew does not necessarily entail that the verb is nonactive. Instead, the affix indicates the presence of a functional head which manipulates arguments in a systematic way. Once the behavior of this functional head is properly understood, the different readings of ``middle'' verbs fall out, as does the fact that their morphophonology is uniform.

The empirical domain departs from the well-studied affixes and clitics of the European languages mentioned above and focuses on the two Hebrew verbal templates \textbf{\tnif}~and \textbf{\thit}. Verbs in these templates are never transitive, in that they do not have a subject paired with a direct object. But it is not the case that all verbs in these templates are nonactive: some are agentive. We will see how the interpretations of different Hebrew roots result under this morphology when merged in different syntactic structures. Theoretically, the implications will be explored for a system in which different argument structure alternations arise without recourse to specialized operators such as a decausativizer or reflexivizer. As a result, ``middle'' morphology will be dissociated from nonactive syntax and there will be two ways of getting to each of the two templates under discussion.

The analysis of these two templates will also serve to explain why ``intensive middle'' \thit~is the only Hebrew template that houses reflexive and reciprocal verbs, even though ``middle'' \tnif~would have been an equally likely candidate. The analysis of reflexives and reciprocals will use the same functional head embedded in different contexts, obviating the need for distinct reflexivizers and reciprocalizers. One consequence of the theory developed here is that reflexive and reciprocal verbs need not be considered ``special'' in any way, but arise simply by compositional interpretation of roots and functional heads, at least in Hebrew. This analysis ties in to the overarching issue of Semitic morphology: there is no direct mapping between the phonology (the template) and the semantics, in either direction. Instead, the syntax builds up a hierarchical structure which is then interpreted at the interfaces.

We will now delve deeper into the middle templates, suggesting two main structures for middle verbs. In \S\ref{syn:middle:nonactive} I propose that nonactive middle verbs are unaccusative, built using the functional head \vz. I then argue in \S\ref{syn:middle:active} that active middle verbs always take a prepositional phrase complement, built using the functional head \pz. This kind of structure permits an external argument in Spec,VoiceP, rendering the verb active. I develop this idea in what follows, arguing for identical morphophonological forms for separate underlying structures. The basic intuition behind this analysis is that some middle verbs seem more volitional than others, just like in English unaccusative \emph{arrive} is more volitional than unaccusative \emph{break}, a matter I return to in \S\ref{syn:middle:roots}.



		\subsubsection{Inchoatives}
Unlike with anticausative verbs, it is not always the case that an active version of a middle verb exists in another template. Some middle verbs could not have been derived from a counterpart in \tkal~or \tpie~because the root was never instantiated in the active template in the first place. For example, \emph{hit'alef} is not derived from active *\emph{ilef}. Call these middle verbs \emph{inchoatives}.

That inchoatives like those in~(\ref{ex:incho}) are nonactive as well can be shown by their incompatibility with \emph{by}-phrases and agent-oriented adverbs, where no external cause is possible, as well as by the standard unaccusativity diagnostics.

The full structures for both kinds of verbs are as follows. Nonactive middles are derived using the head \vz. As this head does not allow anything to be merged in its specifier, no external argument can be introduced into the structure. The difference between \tnif~in (\ref{ex:trees-nact}a) and \thit~in (\ref{ex:trees-nact}b) is that \thit~is the result of \edit[merging]{adjoining} \va\edit{ to \vz}. This morpheme is an additional root which I discuss at more length in \S\S\ref{syn:middle:reflrecip}, \ref{syn:templates:tpie}. For now, let us assume that this root has the phonological \edit[effect]{realization} of \edit[adding]{added} vowels and \edit[blocking]{blocked} spirantization (\dgs{Y} in \thit). When it is adjoined to default Voice it derives the ``intensive'' template \tpie.

Before proceeding to active middles, it is worth exploring in more detail the implications of semantically inert elements.

  \subsubsection{Null allosemy in inchoatives} \label{syn:middle:nonactive:null}
I have assumed that certain configurations allow for interpretations of the root conditioned by a high functional head (e.g.~Voice) over a lower functional head (e.g.~v). The theory involved is one in which allosemy is calculated over semantically contentful elements only, just as allomorphy is calculated over phonologically contentful (overt) elements only. The \tnif~template will serve as a case in point.

In~(\ref{ex:allosemy-decaus}a), the combination of v and \root{root} results in a contentful combination, the verb \emph{sagar} `closed'. This root can have various related meanings, but at this point in the derivation its meaning has been fixed. As a consequence, any higher material will only be able to manipulate this meaning \citep{arad03}, not select another meaning of the root. \vz~has a syntactic function: it blocks merger of a DP in its specifier. As a result, the VoiceP will be interpreted as a detransitivized version of the vP,~(\ref{ex:allosemy-decaus}b). These are the anticausatives discussed above.
\pex Locality in interpretation: anticausatives.\label{ex:allosemy-decaus}
    \a \fbox{{[}v \root{sgr}~\!]} = \emph{sagar} `closed'
    \a {[} \fbox{\textbf{\vz}} \fbox{[\emph{close}]} ] = \emph{nisgar} `got closed'
\xe

If a given root combines with v to be verbalized, it is possible that v introduces an event but carries no additional semantic content when combined with this root. \edit[In that case, v does not select the root's alloseme. ]No verb results in this configuration,~(\ref{ex:allosemy-incho}a). As a result, the next functional head will have a chance to select the interpretation of the root, as with \vz~in~(\ref{ex:allosemy-incho}b). These are the inchoatives discussed above.
\pex Locality in interpretation: inchoatives.\label{ex:allosemy-incho}
    \a \fbox{{[}v \root{rdm}~\!]} -- does not exist
    \a {[} \fbox{\textbf{\vz}} \fbox{[(v) \root{rdm}~\!]} ] = `fell asleep'
\xe
In a sense, the root selects for a specific additional functional head; similar constructions can be found in Romance languages. \cite{burzio86} observes what he calls an ``inherently reflexive'' verb which requires the nonactive clitic \emph{si} (Italian \gsc{SE}). Glosses are his.
\pex \citet[39]{burzio86}, Italian:
	\a \begingl
		\gla Giovanni \textbf{si} sbaglia//
		\glb Giovanni himself mistakes//
		\glft `Giovanni is mistaken.'//
	\endgl
	
	\a \ljudge{*} \begingl
		\gla Giovanni sbaglia Piero//
		\glb Giovanni mistakes Piero//
		\glft (int. `Giovanni mistakes Piero')//
	\endgl
\xe
\ex \citet[70]{burzio86}, Italian:\\
	\begingl
		\gla Giovanni \textbf{se} ne pentir\'a//
		\glb Giovanni himself of.it will.repent//
		\glft `Giovanni will be sorry for it.'//
	\endgl
\xe
\ex
	\begingl
		\gla Giovanni ci \textbf{si} \'e arrangiato//
		\glb Giovanni there himself is managed//
		\glft `Giovanni has managed it.'//
	\endgl
\xe
The forms *\emph{sbaglia} and *\emph{pentir\'a} are not possible without \gsc{SE}; some verbs simply require \gsc{SE} or the equivalent nonactive marker in their language, however encoded.\footnote{The facts are slightly more complicated: \emph{sbaglia} `mistake' is possible in certain contexts but I believe that the generalization about \emph{pentirsi} `repent' is robust \citep[40]{burzio86}.} The famous case of deponents in Latin is similar: as discussed by grammarians and by contemporary authors such as~\cite{aronoff94}, deponents are verbs with nonactive morphology but active syntax. Although they appear with a nonactive suffix, the verbs themselves are unergative or transitive. The deponent verb \emph{sequor} `to follow' is syntactically transitive but has no morphologically active forms:
\pex
    \a Regular Latin alternation:\\
        \emph{amo-r} `I am loved' $<$ \emph{am\=o} `I love'
    \a Deponent Latin verb:\\
        \emph{sequo-r} `I follow' $\nless$ *\emph{sequ\=o} `I follow'
\xe
Similar patterns are discussed for Latin, German, Greek and Icelandic by \cite{embick04}, \cite{kallulli13}, \cite{kastnerzu15li} and \cite{wood15springer}. I do not have anything theoretically impactful to say about how individual roots implement their requirement for nonactive morphology. We simply note that the theory allows such a \edit[construction]{selectional requirement} to be interpreted.

		\subsubsection{Null allosemy in \thit} \label{syn:middle:nonactive:elena}
I have presented inchoatives in \tnif~which are not derived from underlying active verbs. Similar examples can be found in \thit, where \va~is doing its regular morphophonological work but is not available to create ``intensive'' verbs in \tpie.
\ex \emph{hit'alef} `fainted' ($\nless$ *\emph{ilef} `int. made someone faint')
\xe
{\va} contributes general agentive meaning. In this case, I require that the root ``turn off'' the semantic contribution of \va, and with it the ability of \va~to choose an alloseme of the root itself. Yet \va~still contributes morphophonological information, as expected. This state of affairs is true for nonactive verbs such as inchoatives:
\pex 
	\a \label{ex:incho1} \begingl
	\gla dani \underline{hit'ateʃ} \emph{\{}me-ha-avak / ??be-xavana\emph{\}}//
	\glb Danny sneezed.\gsc{INTNS.MID} \phantom{\{}from-the-dust {} \phantom{??}on-purpose//
	\glft `Danny sneezed because of the dust/??on purpose'//
	\endgl
	
	\a \label{ex:incho2} \begingl
	\gla josi \underline{hit'alef} \emph{\{}me-ha-xom / ??be-xavana\emph{\}}//
	\glb Yossi fainted.\gsc{INTNS.MID} \phantom{\{}from-the-heat {} \phantom{??}on-purpose//
	\glft `Yossi fainted due to the heat/??on purpose'//
	\endgl
\xe

Impoverishment of \va~for these roots proceeds as in~(\nextx). Note that this is a case of Impoverishment in the semantics \citep{nevins15roots}---which operates at a distance---rather than local allomorphy\edit[:]{ or allosemy: {\va} is rendered null in the context of certain roots. The rule of impoverishment is given in} (\nextx a) and its effect in the semantics is shown in (\nextx b).
\pex\label{sem:thit-incho}
	\a \edit{\denote{\va~} $\rightarrow$ \zero~/ \trace~\{\root{XYZ} | \root{XYZ} $\in$ \root{pr\dgs{k}} `\gsc{DISMANTLE}', \root{bʃl} `\gsc{COOK}', \dots\}}
	\a \denote{\va~} = $\lambda$P.P~/ \trace~\{\root{XYZ} | \root{XYZ} $\in$ \root{pr\dgs{k}} `\gsc{DISMANTLE}', \root{bʃl} `\gsc{COOK}', \dots\}
\xe
There is an intuition captured by~(\lastx), namely that these roots are understood to be active (by convention). This list of roots could be simply called ``Class 1'', but keeping with our overarching theme of lexical and functional material, I will call them Other--Oriented roots: dismantling, cooking and so on are usually activities carried out on \edit[someone]{something} else. By making this division we are able to see how the requirements of different roots are imposed at the interfaces. In this case, semantic information is relevant at Transfer to LF. I return to the derivation of other root classes in \thit~in \S\ref{syn:middle:reflrecip}, and to the question of different root classes in different structures in \S\ref{syn:middle:roots}.

Turning to a possible crosslinguistic parallel, it has recently been pointed out that in some languages, verbalizing suffixes do not contribute eventive semantics in certain environments. That is, they are phonologically overt but semantically null, a slightly different situation than ours. \citet{elenasamioti13,elenasamioti14} document a pattern in Greek in which certain adjectives can only be derived if a verbalizing suffix is added to the root first. Crucially, there is no eventive semantics (unlike with our inchoatives); no weaving is entailed for~(\ref{ex:elena1}) nor planting for~(\ref{ex:elena2}). \edit{The authors suggest that -\emph{tos} requires an eventive vP as its base, which is not possible with nominal roots like `weave' and `plant'.}
\ex \label{ex:elena1} \emph{if-an-tos} weave-\gsc{VBLZ}-\gsc{ADJ} `woven'
\xe
\ex \label{ex:elena2} \emph{fit-ef-tos} plant-\gsc{VBLZ}-\gsc{ADJ} `planted' \hfill \citep[97]{elenasamioti14}
\xe
In fact, the part of the structure consisting of the root and verbalizer might not even result in an acceptable verb \citep[100]{elenasamioti14}:
\ex \emph{kamban-a} `bell' $\sim$ ??\emph{kamban-iz-o} `bell (v)' $\sim$ \emph{kamban-is-tos} `sounding like a bell'
\xe

In a similar vein, \cite{marantz13} argues that an \emph{atomized individual} need not have undergone atomization, and analyzes a similar phenomenon in Japanese ``continuative'' forms that must be vacuously verbalized first\edit{ before being nominalized} \citep{volpe05}. \cite{anagnostopoulou14thli} extends this idea of a semantically null exponent to cases like -\emph{ify}- in \emph{the class\underline{ifie}ds} (but see \citealt{borer14lingua} for a dissenting view).

Returning to Hebrew, we have some evidence that v and \va~can be active in the phonology without selecting an alloseme of the root, deriving nonactive verbs directly from the root rather than from an existing verb. Crucially here, though, little v still introduces an event variable. This analysis leaves open the possibility of the unattested form \emph{'ilef} in \tpie~arising as an innovation. This does seem to be the case: although \emph{hit'alef} `fainted' is not derived from active *\emph{'ilef} in standard usage, for some younger speakers it is possible to say ^{\%}\emph{'ilef} to mean `amazed' figuratively \citep{laks14}.
