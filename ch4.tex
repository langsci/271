\section{Introduction}
In Chapter \ref{chap:vz} we explored the workings of {\vz}, a non-active head responsible for various processes, the most notable of them being anticausativization. The literature on transitivity alternations has, to a large extent, focused on comparing transitive verbs to their anticausative counterparts. It is perhaps no accident that this literature has also been based for the most part on European languages.

In this chapter we will probe the function of {\vd}, a functional head distinct from ordinary Voice (and as such a novel theoretical proposal). I will first describe the general properties of {\vd} and how the template it gives rise to, {\thif}, participates in alternations, in Section~\ref{vd:vd}.\footnote{This template usually appears in the literature as \emph{h\textbf{i}XYiZ}, with an /i/-/i/ vocalic pattern. Yet contemporary speakers use /ɛ/, as documented for example by \cite{trachtman16}, and so I transcribe ``e'' throughout. Conversely, the initial /h/ is usually dropped in speech but is retained in my transcription for two reasons. First, /h/ is still pronounced by some older speakers and certain sociolinguistic groups, often marginalized ones \citep[cf.~][]{schwarzwald81biu,gafter14phd}. And second, the initial \emph{h}- should help non-Semitist readers to distinguish this template from other ones.} We will then look more closely at the relationship between a verb in {\tkal} and its alternants in {\tnif} and {\thif}, in Section~\ref{vd:caus}. This discussion will be followed in Section~\ref{vd:inch} by an examination of cases in which anticausative verbs appear. Section~\ref{vd:others} considers some alternative approaches and Section~\ref{vd:sum} summarizes.

\section{An active Voice head} \label{vd:vd}
This chapter discusses {\vd}, a syntactic head with a [+D] feature, requiring a DP in Spec,Voice. Having seen evidence for underspecified Voice and non-active {\vz} in Hebrew, let us begin with the empirical motivation for {\vd}.

The following core observation has been guiding us throughout this book: Hebrew shows morphological marking of both causative and anticausative forms, in addition to a ``simple'' verbal form, which itself can be either causative or anticausative. See in particular the middle column of~(\nextx), repeated from Chapter~\ref{chap:voice}.

A few full examples are given for causatives in~(\nextx)--(\anextx) and for an unergative in~(\ref{ex:vd:unerg}).

A few more alternations between an active verb {\tkal} (transitive or non-core transitive) and a causative in {\thif} are presented in~(\nextx).
\ex\label{ex:vd:kal-thif}
\raisebox{-3em}{ \begin{tabular}{l|l|ll|ll}

It is now clearer why the template {\thif} is traditionally called the ``causative'' one: verbs instantiated in it are often causative versions of a verb in {\tkal} (or {\tnif}). A few examples of a the causative alternation in this tempalte are given in~(\nextx a). Many verbs are also causative without alternating, as in~(\nextx b), and others are unergative,~(\nextx c). This is the usual case in {\thif}: of the 550--600 verbs in this template, over 500 fit in this list.

Many of the unergatives are most natural with an indirect object, e.g.~\emph{heria le-} `cheered for'. The list in~(\lastx) does not attempt to exhaust the possible syntactic configurations of verbs in {\thif}. It is there simply to show why this template has traditionally been viewed as causative. But it is more accurate to say that the template is predominantly \emph{active}, i.e.~it has an agentive, external argument.

If it is true that there is an external argument regardless of the root, the presence of this argument should be encoded in the syntax. This goal is achieved using {\vd}: it requires that a DP be merged in its specifier, guaranteeing that an external argument appear.\footnote{Again abstracting away from the difference between Agents and Causers, regarding which see Chapter~\ref{chap:voice}.}
\pex 
	\a \textbf{\vd:}\\

	\a {\vd} {\lra} {\thif} \hfill (see \citealt{kastner18nllt} for the morhophonological details)
\xe

The semantics of {\vd} in~(\lastx b) will be slightly modified in Section~\ref{vd:inch:template}. The structure is straightforwardly as in~(\nextx), where {\vd} obligatorily introduces an external argument.

            ]
        ]
    \xe

This proposal is, on its own, enough to describe most of the empirical landscape. In Section~\ref{vd:inch} I return to a handful of cases in which inchoative verbs appear in {\thif}, perhaps surprisingly. But first, there are a number of consequences of causation that are worth exploring.

\section{The causative-causative alternation} \label{vd:caus}
Recall the basics of the anticausative alternation which we have been assuming. Both (marked) anticausatives and (unmarked) causatives share a common base, formally the vP. This phrase is a predicate over eventualities, to which Voice can add an external argument \citep{schaefer08,layering15}, (\nextx).
\pex 
	\a \emph{John} \textbf{Voice} [_{\text{vP}} \emph{broke the glass}].
	\a \textbf{\vz} [_{\text{vP}} \emph{The glass broke}].
\xe

Considering the current proposal, how and why would {\vd} differ from underspecified Voice? If Voice allows the grammar to add an external argument, what's left for an additional device (\vd) to do, the hypothetical (\nextx)?
\ex \emph{John} \textbf{\vd} [_{\text{vP}} \emph{broke the glass}].
\xe

Since the syntactic behavior is identical as far as licensing a specifier is concerned, in this section I will discuss the semantic difference between the resulting causative verbs. Concretely, I will argue that Voice-causatives are more transparent than {\vd}-causatives, whereby the morphological markedness of the latter mirrors some semantic markedness or opacity.

		\subsection{Markedness in causation} \label{vd:caus:marked}
Very little contemporary work has analyzed causative alternations in depth within a general theory of argument structure alternations; such work normally draws on languages like Japanese \citep{jacobsen92} that are typologically distant from Indo-European ones. \citet[62ff]{layering15} speculate that a marked causative should entail thematic Voice (semantically if not syntactically), but as far as I know no proposal has explored the implications of marked anticausatives and marked causatives existing side by side.

For concreteness, let us give the two alternations the names in~(\nextx). The claim will be that the marked alternation is marked not only morphologically but also semantically.
\ex
\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}
	&	Anticausative & Causative & Causative\\\hline
Basic alternation	& {\vz} & Voice &   \\
Marked alternation		&		&  Voice & {\vd}\\
\end{tabular}
\xe

The first question to ask is how prevalent these two alternations are. The basic alternation was discussed at length in Chapter~\ref{vz:nact}. For the marked alternation, various examples were already given in~(\ref{ex:vd:kal-thif}). Of 300+ pairs of {\tkal}--{\thif} alternations in my database, 64 show the marked alternation.%\footnote{The other @ exhibit a causative alternation of the kind seen in the second set of rows in~(\ref{vd:ex:alternations-heb-long}a).}

%A rough count is as follows:
%
%{\tnif} total @@
%	{\tnif} anticausatives @@
%		Basic alternation with {\tkal} @@
%{\thit} total @@
%	{\thit} anticausatives @@
%		Basic alternation with {\tpie} @@
%{\thif} total 550@
%	{\thif} actives 500@
%		Marked alternation with {\tkal} @@
%
%It is fairly clear that both types of alternation are well attested.

The second question is whether there is a difference between the semantics of the alternations, and here I believe the basic alternation is more transparent. The question is one of predictability: given the anticausative variant, can we predict the meaning of the causative variant. In the basic alternation, the answer is usually affirmative, just like with the prototypical \emph{break}-\emph{break} and \emph{open}-\emph{open} examples in English; the basic alternation in Hebrew was discussed in depth in Chapter~\ref{vz:nact:anticaus}. A few examples were seen again above, one is elaborated on in~(\nextx):
\pex
	\a \emph{nixtav} `was written'\\
		Writing event of a DP, no cause specified.
	\a \emph{katav} `wrote'\\
		Writing event of a DP, external argument specified in the syntax and understood as agent.
\xe

I suggest that the causative variant of a basic alternation introduces a direct causer \citep{bittner99,kratzer05} but that the external argument in the marked alternation is less restricted.\footnote{A similar intuition was expressed by \citep{doron03}, where the strongest claims about a template's meaning were limited to cases in which a root alternates between two templates.} For the marked causative, the informal phrasing in~(\nextx) will do for now (I return below to the question of whether a writing event even holds in these cases):
\ex \emph{hextiv} `dictated'\\
	Writing event of a DP, external argument specified in the syntax and understood as an (indirect) causer.
\xe

In terms of syntax, there is no difference between the constructions. 
\pex 
	\a \begingl
		\gla ha-talmidim \textbf{katvu} et ha-nosim//
		\glb the-students wrote \gsc{ACC} topics//
		\glft `The students wrote down the list of topics.'//
		\endgl\\
		\Tree [. [.students ] [. [.Voice ] [. [.\root{\gsc{WROTE}} ] [.topics ] ] ] ]		
	\a \begingl
		\gla ha-more \textbf{hextiv} et ha-nosim (la-talmidim)//
		\glb the-teacher dictated \gsc{ACC} topics to.the-students//
		\glft `The teacher dictated the list of topics (to the students).//
	\endgl\\
		\Tree [. [.teacher ] [. [.{\vd} ] [. [.\root{\gsc{WROTE}} ] [.topics ] ] ] ]
\xe

In the basic alternation, adding a causer to writing immediately identifies the writer. But adding the marked causer changes the event slightly: the teacher does not cause writing to occur, strictly speaking. Rather, he is the causer of a dictating event, which itself brings about the writing down of the topics.

A similar pattern can be seen with \emph{neexal} `was eaten', where the basic variant \emph{axal} means `ate' and the marked variant \emph{heexil (et)} means `fed (s.o.~s.th)'. Why should this be the meaning, and not `made someone eat'? The different kind of event (feeding versus causing to eat) also implies a different position for the eater: subject in the basic variant, object in the marked variant.
\pex
	\a \begingl
		\gla beki axl-a uxmanjot//
		\glb Becky ate-\gsc{F} blueberries//
		\glft `Becky ate blueberries.'//
		\endgl\\
		\Tree [. [.\textbf{Becky} ] [. [.Voice ] [. [.\root{\gsc{ATE}} ] [.blueberries ] ] ] ]
	\a \begingl
		\gla aba heexil et beki (uxmanjot)//
		\glb dad fed \gsc{ACC} Becky blueberries//
		\glft `Dad fed Becky (blueberries).'//
		\endgl\\
		\Tree [. [.Mary ] [. [.{\vd} ] [. [.\root{\gsc{ATE}} ] [.\textbf{Becky} ] ] ] ]
\xe

This contrast illustrates the limits of syntax within the current system: it can rigidly dictate which elements go where, but the structure itself is not driven by semantic or lexical-semantic considerations.

A few more examples of the marked alternation are given in~(\nextx), showing that the exact type of ``causative'' relation for the marked variant is not uniform.\footnote{The lexical semantics of the root could have something to do with the type of causation in the marked alternation, but I leave that question open for future work.}

\footnotetext{E.g.~memories or emotions.}

The last examples,~(\lastx h--j), are particularly revealing: to extradite someone is in no way an obvious semantic extension of ``closing'' them. More examples like this can be found, in which the basic alternant has predictable semantics but the marked one does not.

Before we go on to discuss the consequences of these differences, it is important to note a possible objection. The fact that marked causatives can vary so widely in their interpretation from the basic variants could be taken as an argument against treating these verbs as sharing the same abstract root. That is to say, why should we even think that closing and extraditing share the same root? Would that not be stretching its assumed shared semantics too thin? I will not defend the current position here, as I believe the overall picture emerging from this book and from work treating roots more directly is that we do want to discuss abstract roots, but be more specific in what their shared meaning is and under which circumstances it can vary.

More concretely, however, we can make an argument from the lack of doublets. There are no \emph{additional} verbs in {\tnif} that alternate with {\thif}. That is to say, suppose that \emph{nikra} `was read' and \emph{kara} `read' are derived from \root{krj1} and that \emph{hekri} `read out' was derived from a homophonous root \root{krj2}. Assume similarly that \emph{nisgar} `closed' and \emph{sagar} `closed' were derived from \root{sgr1} but that \emph{hesgir} `extradited' was derived from \root{sgr2}. And so on for all cases of non-predictable causative variants. If this were the case, we would suppose that \root{krj2} and \root{sgr2} could also be instantiated with other functional heads, for instance with {\vz} to create an anticausative in {\tnif}. But this is not the case: there is no \#\emph{nikra} `was read out' to alternate with \emph{hekri} `read out', and no \#\emph{nisgar} `got extradited' to alternate with \emph{hesgir} `extradited'. In other words, there are no \emph{doublets} (compare the discussion of root suppletion in \citealt{harley14thlia,harley14thlib,harley15roots} and \citealt{borer14thli}).

		\subsection{Markedness in Voice heads} \label{vd:caus:markvoice}
The observations made so far bring us to the proposed generalization for causitivity marking in~(\nextx).
\pex\label{ex:vd:causgen}\textbf{The causative generalization for transitivity alternations}\\
	If a language has both anticausative and causative marking:
	\a The anticausative alternation is transparent.
	\a The causative alternation is not (root-specific).
\xe

This discussion of causative marking will conclude by examining whether~(\lastx) can be derived directly from our theoretical assumptions. I believe that it can. Concretely, this generalization follows directly from the general layering approach to transitivity alternations. If the base vP already has causation, then it is clear what \emph{not} adding an external argument would mean: that is the anticausative alternant. Adding an external argument, as noted above, amounts to introducing the most direct agent. This much derives~(\lastx a). Say we have an event of causation, (\nextx):
\ex
\Tree
	[.vP
		[.v ]
		[.DP ]
	]
\xe


Not adding a causer is easy, (\nextx):
\ex
\Tree
[.VoiceP
	[.{\vz} ]
	[.vP
		[.v ]
		[.DP ]
	]
]
\xe

For~(\ref{ex:vd:causgen}b) We will need to assume that structures derived with different Voice heads will have different meanings, perhaps by some principle of economy.
%The question is now how to differentiate between the two meanings, and the answer is that adding an external argument necessitates a change in meaning as well.
Then, various kinds of external arguments can go with different causation events:
\ex a.
\Tree
[.VoiceP
	[.DP_1 ]
	[.
		[.Voice ]
		[.vP
			[.v ]
			[.DP ]
		]
	]
]
b.
\Tree
[.VoiceP
	[.DP_2 ]
	[.
		[.{\vd} ]
		[.vP
			[.v ]
			[.DP ]
		]
	]
]
\xe

This result makes sense if {\vd} is a marked head which only appears once the language already has underspecified Voice. In other words, the two heads stand in an implicational relationship and we do not expect to find a language with {\vd} (and {\vz}) but without Voice.

On the other hand, it is not possible to have various kinds of \emph{lack} of external arguments. This point brings us to a novel prediction, namely that a specific kind of argument structure triplet should be highly rare, if not impossible.
\pex \textbf{The triplet prediction for argument structure alternations}\\
	If a language has both anticausative and causative marking:
	\a Triplets of the form [marked \underline{unaccusative} $\sim$ unmarked \textbf{causative} $\sim$ marked causative] may be possible.
	\a Triplets of the form [marked \underline{unaccusative} $\sim$ unmarked \textbf{\underline{unaccusative}} $\sim$ marked causative] will not be possible.
\xe	

We have already seen examples of triplets such as those predicted by~(\lastx a) to exist in~(\ref{vd:ex:triplets-caus}). Those like~(\lastx b) are much more difficult to find. The following two triplets could be argued to exist in Hebrew:
\pex 
	\a \root{xrv} `\root{\gsc{DEMOLISH}}': \emph{nexrav} $\sim$ ??\emph{xarav} $\sim$ \emph{hexriv}
	\a \root{ʃlm} `\root{\gsc{BE.WHOLE}}': \emph{niʃlam} $\sim$ ??\emph{ʃalam} $\sim$ \emph{heʃlim}
\xe
In both cases, the {\tkal} form is archaic and exists in contemporary speech only in a few set idioms, if at all. Speakers seem to prefer the {\tnif} form for the anticausative, in accordance with~(\blastx).

A final point about the semantic flexibility of {\vd} concerns its productivity. The template {\thif} is a productive causative template \citep{lev16,kastner18tlr} in which speakers may innovate new forms on the fly. The verb \emph{taka} `stuck' is an ordinary transitive verb in Hebrew, but the online comment in~(\nextx) innovates \emph{hetkia} in {\thif}, presumably for literary effect. The article concerns a roller coaster which became stuck mid-ride on a Saturday, the prescribed day of rest, stranding those riding it for the better part of an hour.
\ex `Why don't you understand that the roller coaster also wanted to observe the Sabbath and rested 40 minutes {\dots}' \\

Additional examples can be found in \cite{lev16}.

In such cases, there is no strong prediction with regards to the kind of causation event; our expectation would be that different kinds of causation would be possible, as was the case for the examples in~(\ref{vd:ex:triplets-caus}). This much also seems to be correct. The verb \emph{hexʃid}, from \emph{xaʃad} `suspected', is attested in both readings: `be suspected', `be made into a suspect' in~(\nextx) and `make X suspect s.th' in~(\anextx).

In sum, there are clear compositional differences with the marked causative alternation: forms built from Voice are transparent, while those built from {\vz} are marked.

\section{The inchoative alternation} \label{vd:inch}
The approach taken in this book has been to develop a basic theoretical framework, test its immediate predictions, and then explore the empirical picture. This chapter has so far implemented {\vd} in Section~\ref{vd:vd} and explored causative marking in Section~\ref{vd:caus}. We will now look examine cases which appear not to be predicted by the most basic reading of the theory.

As noted already in our discussion of markedness, Hebrew does not generally have the alternation referred to as ``labile'', ``zero-derivation'' or ``conversion'' (as with English transitive and intransitive \emph{break}$\sim$\emph{break}), with the exception of certain verbs in {\thif}. A handful of examples are attested in other templates, including \emph{a{\texttslig}ar} `stopped' (often dispreferred to \emph{nee{\texttslig}ar} as an inchoative), \emph{miher} `hurried' and \emph{ixer} `delayed', although the latter two are not part of my own causative vocabulary. In Section~\ref{vd:vd} I mentioned that over 500 of the 550--600 verbs in {\thif} are active. In this section, I explore the 33 that do undergo the labile alternation.

In this section I use the label \textbf{inchoative} as a descriptive term: an inchoative verb in {\thif} is one in which the sole argument has undergone the change of state (or changed on a scale). \textbf{Causative} is likewise a descriptive term in this section, identical in use to ``transitive'': a structure with an external argument and an internal argument (complement to the verb). The two kinds will receive different analyses in Section~\ref{vd:inch:template}. The alternation is exemplified by \emph{hefʃir} `thawed' in~(\nextx).
\pex\label{ex:vd:thif-hefSir}
	\a \begingl
		\gla ha-jaxasim ben ʃtej ha-medinot \textbf{hefʃir-u} axarej bikur roʃ ha-memʃala//
		\glb the-relations between both the-states thawed.\gsc{CAUS}-\gsc{3PL} after visit head.\gsc{CS} the-government//
		\glft `The relations between the two countries thawed after the PM's visit.'//

		\glft `The PM's visit thawed the relations between the two countries.'//
		\endgl
\xe

Some examples of verbs that undergo the alternation are given in~(\nextx). Even in those cases where the inchoative is frequent, a causative context can be set up fairly easily. Full lists are given later on, in Section~\ref{vd:inch:roots}.

	\a \textbf{Unaccusative preferred but causative innovation attested:} \emph{heedim} `reddened', \emph{helbin} `whitened', \emph{heʃxir} `blackened', \emph{hevri} `got healthy',

			\endgl
		\xe
		} \emph{her{\texttslig}in} `became serious', \dots
\xe

As mentioned in particular in Chapter~\ref{vz:nact:anticaus:unacc}, unaccusativity judgments can be fickle in Hebrew: the ``possessive dative'' of \cite{borergrodzinsky86} has been critiqued by \cite{gafter14li} and \cite{linzen14pd}, while verb preposing (Verb-Subject order in an otherwise SVO language, \citealt{shlonsky87}) is not necessarily reliable as a diagnostic of deep unaccustivity \citep{kastner17gjgl}. Nevertheless, it is possible to find unaccusative verbs in \thif~which perform satisfactorily on the Verb-Subject order diagnostic, as the examples in~(\nextx) show. \citet[149]{borer91} likewise argues that inchoatives in {\thif} can be either unergative or unaccusative. Accordingly, I will assume that all three constructions (transitive, unergative and unaccusative) are possible in this template in principle.

I have classified the alternating verbs by the alternations they participate in. Barring a judgment survey, and given that I know of no comparable lists, the lists below reflect my own intuitions. Some verbs are equally acceptable in both alternations, as with \emph{hefʃir} `thawed' in~(\ref{ex:vd:thif-hefSir}). Others are predominantly used as inchoatives, though causative uses have been attested.

The remainder of this section will illustrate what is special about roots such as those in~(\ref{ex:vd:thif-alt}) that allows their verbs to alternate, on the one hand, and what is special about the morphological template that allows some verbs to alternate, on the other hand (based on \citealt{kastner18tlr}). A satisfying analysis of these patterns must address two questions: why these roots and why this template. I take these up in turn.

	\subsection{Roots} \label{vd:inch:roots}
Based on my database, approximately 550--600 verbs exist in Modern Hebrew {\thif}. Of these, 33 show the causative-inchoative alternation by my own estimate. A number of estimates can be found in the recent literature: \cite{arad05} counted 11 such verbs in her corpus whereas \cite{laks11} found 34. \cite{lev16} counted 81 in a survey taking into account many naturally attested, but perhaps spurious, forms. My 33 alternating verbs are broken down as follows: 15 alternating unergatives and 18 alternating unaccusatives.

The analytical question is whether we can identify which roots form verbs that participate in the labile alternation. I propose a pretheoretical classification intor verb classes which is based on the existing verbs, rather than on categories such as those in \cite{levin93}. In this section I classify these verbs according to the broad lexical semantics of the root, building towards the claim that they are all degree achievements.

	\subsubsection{Classification}
Table~\ref{tab:vd:thif-roots} lists the alternating verbs in~{\thit}. The first three rows show classes where the only inchoatives are unergative. The next row (change of color) shows a class in which the only inchoatives are unaccusative. Verbs in the other classes may be unergative or unaccusative, decided on a verb-by-verb basis. I also list whether there are transitive verbs in this template whose lexical semantics makes them eligible to be part of the verb class.

\end{table}

\footnotetext{Other verbs of emission do not entail change of state: \emph{heki} `threw up', \emph{hezia} `sweat', \emph{hefli\texttslig} `farted'.}


		\subsubsection{Discussion}
A number of tentative generalizations can be drawn from Table~\ref{tab:vd:thif-roots}. For instance, it seems clear that change of color allows for inchoative verbs (unaccusative ones). Yet a large degree of arbitrariness exists, as when we might also have expected the forms in~(\nextx) to exist, contrary to fact. The semantic criteria alone are not enough to predict how all roots in the language will behave.

	\a Change of color:
		*\emph{hesgil} ($\nless$ \emph{sagol} `purple'), *\emph{hektim}/*\emph{hextim} ($\nless$ \emph{katom} `orange').
\xe

It is also not the case that any root in the categories above necessarily derives an inchoative in {\thif}: \emph{heziz} `moved' is a change of direction, \emph{heʃtik} `shut up' is a change of sound and \emph{henmix} `lowered' is a change of physical shape, but these three verbs (and many others) are only causative, never inchoative.

One insightful claim, made recently by \cite{lev16} and endorsed by \cite{kastner18tlr}, is that inchoatives in {\thif} are \textbf{degree achievements}: change of state verbs which are derived from gradable adjectives (see \citealt{dowty91,hayetal99,rotsteinwinter04,kennedylevin08,bobaljik12}, a.m.o). This hypothesis covers a fair bit of empirical ground and I will adopt it in what follows, although it is important to note that it does not account for a few datapoints which \cite{lev16} subsumes under a different part of his analysis. 

	\subsection{Template} \label{vd:inch:template}
Two questions must now be asked about {\vd}: first, how must our understanding of it change? And second, why is it this head alone that leads to labile alternations in the language?

This section concerns itself with the first question of the two. I argue next that causatives have different structure than inchoatives, echoing claims made by \cite{borer91}. Causatives will be argued to be derived from the root, whereas inchoatives will be argued to be derived from an existing adjective or noun.\footnote{From a cross-Semitic perspective, Arabic ``Form 9'' \emph{iXYaZZ} verbs show some parallels with {\thif}, though the Arabic forms are exclusively nonactive.}

		\subsubsection{Structure}
As a first step, I will assume that inchoatives in {\thif} are never derived directly from the root but from an underlying adjective or noun. A similar claim was already made by \cite{borer91}, who argued that causatives are derived directly from the root while these inchoatives are derived from an underlying adjective. As I point out here, inchoatives can also be derived from an underlying noun:
\pex
	\a Underlying adjective: \emph{heedim} $<$ \emph{adom} `red', \emph{heʃmin} $<$ \emph{ʃamen} `fat'.
	\a Underlying noun: \emph{heki} $<$ \emph{ki} `vomit', \emph{he{\texttslig}xin} $<$ \emph{{\texttslig}axana} `stench'.
\xe

The structure is as in~(\nextx).
\ex

             ]
             [.(DP)$_i$ ]
         ]
     ]
 ]	
 }
\xe

This assumption is admittedly a bit of a morphophonological stretch in certain cases. For example, the verb \emph{hei{\texttslig}} `accelerated' is arguably not derived from the noun \emph{teu{\texttslig}a} `acceleration', whose initial /t/ is not preserved \citep{batel94,arad03}. This much indicates that perhaps the claim should be weakened such that some inchoatives are derived from adjectives/nouns and other from the root. Nevertheless, the strong view carries a few benefits. First, it allows us to talk about different constructions in terms of explicit, uniform structures. Second, it allows for the degree semantics of the underlying adjective to transfer to the verb straightforwardly. And third, it makes a correct prediction regarding idiomatic meaning, as I show next.

My theory of morphosemantics assumes the so-called Arad/Marantz hypothesis, according to which the first categorizing head selects the alloseme of the root (Chapter~\ref{vz:inch}). If~(\lastx) is the right structure for inchoatives, it is predicted that for roots which participate in the alternation, the causative might have a meaning that the inchoative does not share. This is because in causatives {\vd} is local enough to the root to select a special meaning, whereas in inchoatives little a or little n will have already chosen an alloseme. This prediction is borne out by idioms involving \emph{helbin} `whitened' with the metaphorical meaning `laundered', as in~(\nextx), and \emph{heʃxir} `blackened' with the metaphorical meaning `tarnished', as in~(\anextx).

\cite{borer91} provides additional arguments for deriving the inchoative from the adjective, which I scrutinize in Section~\ref{vd:others:borer}.

The full semantics for {\vd} now looks as in~(\nextx), without introducing a causer for inchoative events in~(\nextx a--b), in an update to~(\ref{ex:vd:sem}).
\pex\label{ex:vd:sem-full}
	\a \denote{\vd} = $\lambda$e.e / \trace~(v) a \hfill (v does not select an alloseme)
	\a \denote{\vd} = $\lambda$e.e / \trace~(v) n \hfill (v does not select an alloseme)
	\a \denote{\vd} = $\lambda$x$\lambda$e.Cause(x,e) \hfill (or Agent)
\xe


		\subsubsection{Derivation}
The derivation proceeds straightforwardly for most cases, except that we must allow for unaccusative inchoatives. Our definition of {\vd}, however, states that its specifier must be filled. This definition is not compatible with an unaccusative argument remaining, which is a configuration we must allow under the assumption that VS order exemplifies surface unaccusartives, (\ref{ex:vd:vs}).

To account for these cases, assume instead that the [D] feature on {\vd} requires valuation of phi-features \citep{nie17,schaefer17oup}. This valuation proceeds straightforwardly under Spec-Head Agreement but something else needs to be said if the sole argument in the phase is the internal argument. In this case, I propose that [D] can be checked by the internal argument \emph{in situ}: {\vd} probes into its specifier upwards, finds no target, and so it probes downwards and is valued by the internal argument. For more in-depth discussion of the direction of Agree, see works such as \cite{bejarrezac09}, \cite{zeijlstra12}, \cite{preminger13tlr} and \cite{deal15nels}. In Chapter~\ref{chap:i} I turn to a recent proposal about {\vd} which paves the way for a different analysis of inchoatives in {\thif}.

Here is what the current proposal means for an inchoative example like~(\ref{ex:vd:thif-inch}) with the structure in~(\ref{tree:vd:thif-inch}). {\vd} probes its specifier and finds nothing, (\ref{tree:vd:thif-inch}-\ding{172}), so it probes downward and checks its unvalued phi-features with the internal argument \emph{ha-xatul} `the cat' (\ref{tree:vd:thif-inch}-\ding{173}). The derivation converges in the syntax. The interpretation is as in~(\ref{ex:vd:sem-full}a): no Cause is introduced.

For~(\lastx a) there is no adjective `inserted' that could be verbalized and no inchoative can be generated. In~(\lastx b) an adjective \emph{mahir} `quick' does exist, but it cannot be instantiated in {\thif} in general due to some arbitrary gap, as already mentioned in Section~\ref{vd:inch:roots} (or at least, I assume that this is an arbitrary gap, in lieu of a more principled explanation).

Finally, (\ref{ex:counterex}c) is not a possible inchoative even though there exists an underlying adjective, namely \emph{kafu} `frozen'. There are a number of possible explanations which can be pursued. One is that \emph{freeze} is not a degree achievement in Hebrew, and so that adjective is not a possible input to the structure. Another kind of explanation falls along the lines of extra-grammatical paradigmatic pressure, in that an inchoative (non-alternating) freezing verb already exists in another template: \emph{kafa} `froze' in {\tkal}. In this regard, I should note that speakers do steer clear of {\thif} for certain inchoatives, instantiating them in other, more canonically non-active templates: \emph{hitarex} `grew long' in {\thit} rather than \emph{heerix}, \emph{hizdaken} `grew old' in {\thit} rather than \emph{hezkin}, \emph{raza} `thinned' in {\tkal} instead of \emph{herza}, and \emph{hitadem} `reddened' in {\thit} rather than \emph{heedim} (but see \citealt[22]{doron03} for a grammatical difference between the two).

With the formal analysis in place, we can now turn to the final point of the discussion: why is the labile alternation formed with {\vd} specifically?


	\subsection{Discussion: The labile alternation}
The main characteristic of {\vd} is that it guarantees the availability of an external argument; in other words, a transitive construction is possible if the even has change-of-state semantics, i.e.~an internal argument. I have not yet found, or at least not yet noticed, any alternations in which the causative is preferred and the inchoative is a recent innovation; or inchoatives in {\thif} which have no causative counterpart. I take these findings to be emblematic of the causative meaning inherent in {\vd}: even if inchoative verbs have arisen, contemporary usage overwhelmingly tends to coin causatives in this template rather than another kind of verb \citep{laks14}.

Let us continue to assume that the process of inchoative formation in {\thif} is productive, as argued for by \cite{lev16}, and is not merely a list of exceptions, as implicitly assumed in most of the literature (with the exception of \citealt{doron03}, to be discussed in Section~\ref{vd:others:ed}). Then, when the speaker is faced with the choice of a construction for their de-adjectival or denominal verb, they would choose {\vd} because this structure guarantees that an external causer can be added.

One consequence of this analysis is that it allows us to state in formal terms the difference in argument distribution between causatives and inchoatives. As seen in Sections~\ref{vd:vd}--\ref{vd:caus}, active verbs in {\thif} might be unergative, transitive or ditransitive. These possibilities are wiped out for inchoatives, which are uniformly intransitive. Let us assume that whatever requirements a verb has for its complements emerge upon combination of v and the root. I propose that once the structure contains a more deeply embedded a/n node as in~(\ref{tree:vd:thif-inch}), v is too far away from the root for particular selectional requirements to be stated.

This idea receives potential corroboration from the behavior of -\emph{en} in English.\footnote{Thanks to Jim Wood for pointing out this phenomenon.} As noted by \cite{harley09n}, English verbalizers such as -\emph{ify}, \emph{-ize} and \emph{-ate} can derive verbs that are uniformly unaccusative (e.g.~\emph{oscillate}), uniformly unergative (e.g.~\emph{detoriorate}) or labile (e.g.~\emph{activate}), but -\emph{en} verbs are always labile. An examination of the list in \citet[245]{levin93} confirms this claim. If we assume that these latter verbs contain additional structure, for instance [v [CMPR [a \root{Root}~\!]]] \citep{bobaljik12}, we arrive at a similar analysis to that of {\thif} inchoatives: they cannot impose selectional restrictions and are ``stuck'' with the argument structure imposed by the syntax. I will not develop this idea any further at this point.

Finally, the strong claim about separate derivational strategies for causatives and inchoatives awaits a more articulated semantic analysis. As a reviewer for \cite{kastner18tlr} pointed out, in~(\ref{ex:vd:thif-hefSir}) the verb \emph{hefʃir} means `thawed', i.e.~became warmer, while the underlying adjective \emph{poʃer} means `lukewarm', i.e.~not warm. Yet the inchoative does not mean ``became lukewarm''. Another incongruity between verb and adjective can be seen with \emph{heʃmin}, `grew fatter', which does not entail that its argument becomes \emph{ʃamen} `fat'. Important discussion of the relevant scales and entailments is given by~\cite{borer91} which I turn to in the discussion of alternatives, the subject of the next section.

\section{Alternative accounts} \label{vd:others}
I focus below on a number of competing analyses aiming to explain the behavior of verbs in {\thif}, mostly focusing on the inchoative alternation. Apart from these, \cite{lev16} sketched a theory in which labile verbs are less agentive than others, a claim that could explain why \emph{heet} `slowed down' is possible as opposed to *\emph{hemhir} (from `quick'). However, that idea cannot be extended to explain the existence of minimally different \emph{hei{\texttslig}} `accelerated'. 

In addition, a possible objection to the treatment of marked causatives in cases of low semantic similarity between the two causative forms was already shot down at the end of Section~\ref{vd:caus:marked} based on the lack of doublets.
	
	\subsection{Added structure} \label{vd:others:struct}
Generally speaking, it could be argued that {\vd} does not exist. On this view, verbs in {\thif} are not derived using {\vd} but by additional structure atop of Voice.

Let me briefly outline what such an analysis would look like. This structure would presumably consist of some higher causative head, perhaps another layer of Voice. For variants of the idea that an analytic causative can be deriving using Voice-over-Voice, see \citep{tubinoblanco11},\cite{harley13lingua,harley17oup} and \cite{nie17}. While this idea holds theoretical promise, there are two reasons I do not think it can account for the Hebrew data, having to do with incorrect predictions in the phonology and in the syntax-semantics.

First, {\vd} seems as integrated into the morphophonological system as the other heads, namely Voice and {\vz}. In particular, the analysis in \cite{kastner18nllt} shows that the spell-out of {\vd} is subject to the same locality constraints as that of Voice and {\vz}. Splitting {\vd} into two layers of Voice will disrupt these locality relations, thereby making the wrong predictions in the phonological component.

Second, this approach would treat {\thif} as a straightforward ``make''-causative. This much is clearly wrong for the unergative and unaccusative verbs in this template. In addition, this analysis misses the fact that many causatives in this template are ``lexical'', as discussed in Section~\ref{vd:caus:marked}, meaning that this head will need to be much closer to the root/v. Finally, assuming that another Voice head can be added makes the false prediction that a transitive in {\tkal} and a causative in {\thif} will have the same internal argument. This is once again incorrect, as we saw in Section~\ref{vd:caus:marked}.

Finally, in Chapter~\ref{passn:pass} I discuss how passives are derived by use of an additional head Pass. As explained there, Pass can only attach to {\vd} or to Voice+{\va}, but not to Voice on its own. If we were to assume that {\vd} is actually Voice+Voice, we would need to make an additional stipulation regarding constructions that can be passivized. This last problem is not insurmountable but it would complicate the theory.

	
	\subsection{Existential closure} \label{vd:others:ed}
A different kind of alternative analysis concerns itself mostly with the inchoatives of Section~\ref{vd:inch}. This analysis might posit a silent, generic Cause in Spec,{\vd}. The analysis in \citet[61]{doron03}---which in many ways is a precursor to the theory presented in this work---assumes that a Causative head $\gamma$ gives rise to {\thif}. The problem for the system in \cite{doron03} is that if these verbs are derived using a Causative head rather than a Middle head, we have no explanation for their unaccusativity.

As a result, \citet[62]{doron03} must conclude that ``\emph{x reddened} is equivalent to \emph{Something caused x to redden}'', with the Causative head $\gamma$ introducing a Causer that is existentially quantified over. This kind of account is more in line with a passive analysis than a causative one.

Assume for the sake of the argument that a silent element fills Spec,{\vd} in inchoatives. One would need to specify the exact featural makeup of this element, for example a null subject \emph{pro}. The result would be a transitive structure where \emph{pro} should be assigned Nominative case and the IA should be assigned Accusative case. Definite accusative objects in Hebrew take the direct object marker \emph{et}, so we would predict that \emph{et} appears before inchoatives in \thif. But this is incorrect: the generic Cause cannot be a silent pronoun in a transitive relationship with the internal argument.

		\gla \textbf{et} ha-xatul heʃmin//
		\glb \gsc{ACC} the-cat fattened//
		\glft (int. `The cat grew fat')//
	\endgl
\xe

Another tack would be to say that instead of \emph{pro}, the silent external argument is a Weak Implicit Argument in the sense of \cite{landau10}: a bundle of ɸ-features with no [D] feature, distinguishing it from a Strong Implicit Argument such as \emph{pro}. If there is no [D] feature on the weak EA, it does not participate in the calculus of case and the IA will receive unmarked case, i.e.~Nominative. This analysis ends up being very similar to the one in this chapter: the external argument is not taking part in any relevant syntactic process, and whatever requirements {\vd} has still need to be satisfied. Furthermore, the exact characterization of Weak Implicit Arguments is not fully fleshed out; \citet[380]{landau10} concludes that they may not be direct objects, only oblique objects, and that they may not be subjects of predication, but his system makes no claims as to whether they can function as the generic kind of external argument we would need here. In the absence of a convincing account for implied causers, I reject this analysis.

	\subsection{Alternative: Contextual allomorphy}
Another possible analysis of inchoatives is strictly morphological in nature. Under this account, unaccusative inchoatives are true unaccusatives derived with {\vz}, except that the allomorphic rule in~(\ref{ex:vd:allo-unacc}) causes {\vz} to be pronounced like {\thit} rather than like {\tnif}.
\pex
  \a \vz~\lra~\gsc{CAUS} / \trace~\{\root{lbn}, \root{'dm}, \root{xl\dgs{k}}, \root{xvr}, \root{ʃmn}, \dots \}\label{ex:vd:allo-unacc}
  \a \vz~\lra~\gsc{MID}
\xe

One question which arises is whether we would like to postulate this rule for a list of over 30 roots. Furthermore, the mystery would remain of why it is specifically {\thif} that houses inchoatives: why doesn't the rule in~(\lastx a) insert the form of any other template, such as {\tkal}, {\tnif} or {\tpie}? This solution is technically possible but conceptually unenlightening.

That being said, it does correctly predict that the roots to which this rule applies cannot surface in {\tnif}, only in {\thit}. The reason is that forms in {\tnif} are generated using {\vz}, but {\vz} is pronounced as {\thif}.

	\subsection{Alternative: Verbalizing affix} \label{vd:others:borer}
\cite{borer91} presents an analysis of {\thif} alternations couched in Parallel Morphology, which I will translate into comparable terms in the current theory. Her account consists of two main parts. In the first, she argues that inchoative forms are derived from adjectives while causative forms are derived from a root/verb. In the second, she presents an analysis showing why it must be the case---given certain assumptions---that causatives are formed in the lexicon and inchoatives in the syntax. The current analysis is similar to hers in adopting separate structures for causatives and inchoatives, albeit using different argumentation. The content of the analysis is different, though, since for \cite{borer91} {\thif} is a single verbalizing morpheme which subcategorizes for an adjective.

In her analysis, \citet[136]{borer91} takes Hebrew {\thif} and English -\emph{en} to be verbalizers subcategorizing for an adjectival stem, be it a property root or an adjective. %Both the adjective and the verbalizer are able to---but need not---assign an external theta-role \citep[142]{borer91}.
When this is done in the ``lexicon'' by verbalizing a root, the result is a causative verb:
\ex\label{ex:vd:thif-borer-caus}{[}_{\text{v}} \root{\gsc{wide}} -\emph{en}]
\xe
When this is done in the syntax by verbalizing an adjective, the result is an inchoative verb:
\ex\label{ex:vd:thif-borer-inch}{[}_{\text{v}} [_{\text{a}} \root{\gsc{wide}} a] -\emph{en}]
\xe

Crucially for us, the analysis does not answer the questions posed at the beginning of the discussion: why this template and why these roots. \thif~is assumed to be a de-adjectival verbalizer, just like -\emph{en}, without discussion of this template's role in the overall morphosyntax of the language. While it is stipulated that \thif~as a verbalizer subcategorizes for an adjective, this is not always the case: as shown above, many inchoatives are derived from underlying nouns. More importantly, even run-of-the-mill causatives such as \emph{hexnis} `inserted', \emph{he'exil} `fed' and \emph{helbiʃ} `dressed' are not derived from underlying adjectives, as I show next.

The causative \emph{hexnis} `inserted' is derived from \root{kns}, but without a simple adjective *[_{a} \root{kns} a]. One could posit an abstract adjective that is never lexicalized, but it is unclear what this non-existent adjective would be like or what its phonological form would have been (*\emph{kanus}?).
\ex \begingl
	\gla ha-nasix \textbf{hexnis} et ha-sefer la-tik//
	\glb the-prince inserted.\gsc{CAUS} \gsc{ACC} the-book to.the-bag//
	\glft `The prince put the book in the bag.'//
	\endgl
\xe

The causative \emph{heexil} `fed' is derived from \root{'kl}, but probably not from \emph{axul} `consumed', a rare adjectival passive of \emph{axal} `ate'.
\pex
	\a \begingl
		\gla ha-nasix \textbf{he'exil} et ha-kivsa//

		\glft `The prince caused the sheep to be consumed (e.g.~by worms)'//
		\endgl
\xe

And the causative \emph{helbiʃ} `dressed' is derived from \root{lbʃ}, but probably not from \emph{lavuʃ} `dressed up', the adjectival passive of \emph{lavaʃ} `wore', which seems to be reserved for descriptions of a full costume.

\footnotetext{\url{http://www.oocities.org/sant\_exupery/c4.htm}}
\xe

To be clear, \cite{borer91} did not claim that the sole function of {\thif} is to verbalize adjectives. But even if this is only one of its functions, we have seen that not all verbs in {\thif} show the alternation. As her system stands, it is not clear how it could allow for a certain root to be instantiated only in a ``syntactic'' (inchoative) derivation but not in a ``lexical'' (causative) one.
%Similarly, and as shown above, not all inchoatives in this template are de-adjectival: \emph{heki} `threw up' comes from the noun \emph{ki} `vomit', \emph{hekrim} `clotted' from the noun \emph{krem} `cream', and \emph{hetsxin} `smelled pungent' from the noun \emph{tsaxana} `pungent smell'.
%Another question is whether -\emph{en} and \thif~are productive enough as de-adjectival verbal forms to merit a derivational rule as in the Parallel Morphology system, rather than what is in effect a list of exceptional forms as in mine.

The analysis in \cite{borer91} did not attempt to find an underlying reason for why {\thif} is used for both causatives and inchoatives, as well as for general causativization in the rest of the system. Nevertheless, it remains the only in-depth study of this alternation that I know of. Recall, for the last part of this discussion, that this analysis also postulates a structural difference between {\thif} causatives, (\ref{ex:vd:thif-borer-caus}), and inchoatives, (\ref{ex:vd:thif-borer-inch}). I review this distinction next.

The logic works as follows: if an adjective passes certain diagnostics, and the inchoative does but the causative does not, then the adjective must be embedded in the inchoative \citep[130]{borer91}. Starting with an English example, the adjective \emph{wide} is said to license comparisons with \emph{as}/\emph{like} and comparative forms, whereas the inchoative \emph{widen} does not. \citeauthor{borer91}'s claim is that comparison adverbials and the comparative must be licensed by an adjective (judgments hers).
\pex
  \a The canal is \{as \underline{wide} as a river / \underline{wider} than a river.\}
  \a The canal \underline{widened} \{like a river / more than a river\}.\\
	  (int. `The canal became as wide as a river is wide / became more wide than a river is wide')
  \a \ljudge{*} The flood \underline{widened} the canal \{like a river / more than a river\}.\\
	  (int. `The flood made the canal as wide as a river is wide / made the canal wider than a river is wide')
\xe
I suspect that there is much more variation in acceptability for the utterances in~(\lastx), and that an adverbial reading normally overpowers the scalar one (`The flood widened the canal like a river widens it'){. Three native speaker linguists I have consulted do not share these contrasts} but I leave a judgment survey for future work. Let us return to the novel claims about Hebrew instead.

Taking the adjective \emph{ʃmen-a} `fat-\gsc{F.SG}', it is claimed to license comparatives,~(\nextx a). Inchoatives license comparatives too,~(\nextx b), but causatives do not,~(\nextx c). Judgments are as in \cite{borer91}{; example} (\nextx c) {does not sound as degraded to me, but it does to another speaker whom I consulted informally.}
\pex
  \a Adjective:\\ \begingl
    \gla ha-xatula \textbf{ʃmena} \emph{\{}kmo xazir / joter mi-xazir\emph{\}}//
    \glb the-cat fat like pig {} more than-pig//
    \glft `The cat is fat as a pig / fatter than a pig.'//
  \endgl
  
  \a Inchoative:\\ \begingl
    \gla \underline{ha-xatula} \textbf{heʃmina} \emph{\{}kmo xazir / joter mi-xazir\emph{\}}//
    \glb the-cat fattened like pig {} more than-pig//
    \glft `The cat grew as fast as a pig / fatter than a pig.'//
  \endgl

  \a Causative:\\ \begingl
    \gla \ljudge{*}\underline{ha-zrika} \textbf{heʃmina} et ha-xatula \emph{\{}*kmo xazir / *joter me-xazir\emph{\}}//
    \glb the-injection fattened \gsc{OM} the-cat.\gsc{F} like pig {} more than-pig//
    \glft (int. `The injection made the cat fat as a pig / more than a pig is fat.')//
  \endgl
\xe

Similarly, some adverbs (\emph{haxi ʃe-efʃar} `as much as possible') must be licensed by an adjective and accordingly only appear with inchoatives, not causatives.

It seems to me that the success of this diagnostic depends to a large extent on the lexical items chosen. For example, using the antonym \emph{herza} `grew thin', my judgments are slightly different:
\pex
  \a Adjective:\\ \begingl
    \gla ha-xatula \textbf{raza} \emph{\{}kmo makel / ?joter mi-makel\emph{\}}//
    \glb the-cat thin like stick {} more than-stick//
    \glft `The cat is as thin as a rail / skinnier than a rail.'//
  \endgl
  
  \a Inchoative:\\ \begingl
    \gla\ljudge{?}\underline{ha-xatula} \textbf{herzeta} \emph{\{}kmo makel / ??joter mi-makel\emph{\}}//
    \glb the-cat thinned like stick {} more than-stick//
    \glft (int. `The cat became as thin as a rail / skinnier than a rail.')//
  \endgl

  \a Causative:\\ \begingl
    \gla \ljudge{??}\underline{ha-zrika} \textbf{herzeta} et ha-xatula \emph{\{}kmo makel / joter me-makel\emph{\}}//

    \glft (int. `The injection made the cat as thin as a rail / skinnier than a rail.')//
  \endgl
\xe

With \emph{heet} `slowed down' I judge inchoatives unacceptable and causatives slightly better though still degraded. These judgments are meant to highlight the variance, not to be taken as categorical for all alternations or all speakers.
\pex
	\a Adjective:\\ \begingl
		\gla ha-mexonit ha-zo \textbf{itit} \emph{\{}kmo {\texttslig}av / joter mi-{\texttslig}av\emph{\}}//

	\endgl

	\a Inchoative:\\ \begingl

		\glb the-car the-this slowed like turtle {} more than-turtle//
		\glft (int. `This car slowed down to turtle speed / to sub-turtle speed.')\\
			(More acceptable on a reading of `The car slowed down like a turtle slowed down'.)//
	\endgl

	\a Causative:\\ \begingl

		\glft (int. `The problem with the gear box slowed the car down to turtle speed / to sub-turtle speed.')//
	\endgl
\xe

It is also left vague what precisely this diagnostic is probing. In~(\nextx), for instance, there is no underlying adjective `beloved' but the utterance is completely acceptable:\footnote{Thanks to Idan Landau for pointing this out to me.}
\ex
	\begingl
	\gla ani \textbf{ohev} otxa \underline{kmo} \underline{ax}//

	\glft `I love you like a brother.'//
	\endgl
\xe

The remainder of the article is devoted to working through the different possible structures generated by the framework and discussing whether they are licit or not. The final few pages \citep[150]{borer91} raise the issue of whether these verbs give comparative (change on a scale) or absolute (result) readings, concluding that both are in principle possible but are constrained by the root. That is to say, both English \emph{reddened} and Hebrew \emph{heedim} `reddened' are as compatible with a `became redder' meaning as with a `became red' meaning, but some verbs like \emph{quicken} are only compatible with a `became quicker' meaning (see \citealt[ch.~5]{bobaljik12} and the literature on degree achievements referenced in Section~\ref{vd:inch:template} for relevant discussion).

Since I am not sure that the argument from comparatives generalizes, and given that no explicit syntax or semantics for this modification was put forward, I do not endorse the arguments for distinct structures put forward in \cite{borer91}. Nevertheless, the current proposal has recast that intuition in contemporary terms and supported it using different arguments. Future experimental studies could test the predictions that these theories of {\thif} make for speakers' usage of nonce verbs in this template.


\section{Conclusion} \label{vd:sum}
This chapter developed the theory of [D] in {\vd} based on an in-depth analysis of various verb types in {\thif}. This template predominantly instantiates active verbs, usually causatives. It is also reasonably productive. Yet a number of roots derive inchoative verbs in this template. The analysis proposed here showed how the influence of a certain class of roots can be accommodated in the grammar, while keeping constant the overall behavior of the functional head.

The two factors conspiring to create a labile alternation in a language that otherwise does not allow such an alternation are the root and the syntactic structure. The roots fall under various lexical semantic classes but all appear to derive degree achievements from underlying nouns or adjectives, as suggested by \cite{lev16}. The syntax which facilitates this derivation is one in which a noun or adjective is first formed before it is verbalized, and then combined with a specific causative head {\vd}. This theoretical approach allows us to ask more specific questions about how the idiosyncratic information associated with roots interacts with the syntactic structure in which they are embedded.

Taken together, these last three chapters cashed out the trivalent theory of Voice which is at the core of this book. The next chapter rounds off the empirical picture by examining cases in which these heads interact with additional structure: passivization, adjectival passives and nominalization.
